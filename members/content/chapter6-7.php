<h1>Chapter 6: PTC Mini-Sites</h1>
<hr />
<br /> 

<p>The downside is that the average person, who has little HTML knowledge, will not be able to produce such a mini-site. There is still an answer for them, though. They can create a blogger site for free and never pay a dime. While still useful, blogs offer very little control over the layout and the content of the site, as well as dealing with messy editors. And most importantly, they will not give you exactly what you want.</p>

<p>When you get your own mini-site, this is the link that you’d advertise in various places. Because we have only a few seconds to get the prospect’s attention, a mini-site catch their eye. Your colorful banners will get the prospect’s attention, and they can see everything in one glance. They will choose which sites to join, and who knows, maybe they will join more than one.</p>

<p>Promotion Methods</p>

<p>You can promote your PTC Mini-Site using the same methods that you’d use to promote your capture page. </p>

<p>AutoReply Messages</p>

<p>Like previously mentioned, you can use this method to promote PTC’s. The proper way to set up an auto reply is to put the link to your PTC mini-site in the message. </p>

<p>Doing this has 2 advantages. Firstly, you no longer need to update the sites in your message. The link to your PTC mini-site will never change, you just need to update the content on the website. Secondly, the mini-site link will stir up curiosity in people, and they will more likely click on it. </p>

<h1>Chapter 7: Conclusion</h1>

<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ultimate strategy is building a mailing list, the method that gets the most referrals over time. It requires a small investment and a moderate amount of work, but the rewards you will get are tenfold. </p>

<p>Tying it all together, you need to build a list and advertise to your list. First, join TrafficWave and get a 30-day free trial. Then make a campaign and write some newsletters. After that, you need to make a capture page. Once that is done, test your capture page and newsletters. </p>

<p>Then you can begin advertising your capture page, and only your capture page, nothing else. Promote it using EasyHits4U and referral exchanges. And make sure you use your list to get referrals into EasyHits4U and referral exchanges to get tons of free credits. Those credits can be used to advertise your capture page. </p>

<p>We have mentioned many ways to get direct referrals, some free, some expensive. We will list them here for your reference. </p>

<p>Top ways to get referrals: 
<ul class="neobux">	
	<li>Traffic exchanges (free)</li>
	<li>DownlineRefs (free)</li>
	<li>Have your own website blog (free)</li>
	<li>Ads on Linkgrand / Adhitz / Donkeymails (cheap)</li>
	<li>Advertise on sites with 100K+ members (cheap)</li>
	<li>Neobux micro ads (cheap)</li>
	<li>Build a mailing list (moderate)</li>
	<li>Neobux banner ads (moderate)</li>
	<li>Neobux fixed ads (expensive) </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Here is a summary of what to do when joining a new PTC: </p>

<p>When you first join a new PTC, get as many direct referrals as you can by promoting it within your list. Once you do that you will be earning $$$ from them everyday. Then use that money to rent referrals and renew referrals. In addition to gaining tons of direct referrals and management of rented referrals, you need daily action in order to profit from the referrals’ clicks. As mentioned earlier, you need to commit to clicking everyday, otherwise you are going to lose money.</p>

<p>Also, please keep in mind the following: 
<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Your strategy must include both direct referrals and rented referrals </li>
 	<li>If you have a lot of referrals, you should click everyday</li>
 	<li>Do NOT spend money you cannot afford to lose </li>
 	<li>Re-read this course if you are lost on something</li>
</ul></p>

<p>And we’re done! We gave you all the information you need to know – and now you must apply the strategies. It might seem like a lot of information at first, so take your time and absorb it and learn at your own pace. </p>
