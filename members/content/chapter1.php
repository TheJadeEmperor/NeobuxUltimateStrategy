</p>

<p>In the world of PTC’s, some succeed, but most don’t. Why is that? Because people join PTC’s without having a working strategy. They hope to make a lot of money by doing very little work. That is a mistake, and as a result of this way of thinking, most people will drop out. </p>

<p>In this ebook, we are going to show you a working strategy, which we call the Neobux Ultimate Strategy. Remember that is your responsibility to use these strategies and monitor your progress. Some strategies require a small investment, and you decide how much you are willing to spend. </p>

<p><b>Do not money spend that you cannot afford to lose!</b></p>

<h2>1a: Neobux Recycling Strategy</h2>
<hr class="shortTitle" />
<br />

<p>Generally, there are 4 groups of bad clickers. There may be others that are exceptions, but they are
not important.</p>

<p>1. Referrals who always click 2 ads or less<br />
2. Referrals who click their ads only once in a while<br />
3. Referrals who click many ads, have a great average, last around 30 days, and then die off slowly –
normally they have a slowly decreasing average of 1.1 to 1.6<br />
4. Users who seem to bypass the 14-day free recycle mark by clicking on the 12th or 13th day – these
are the most annoying ones<br />
</p>

<p>Let’s pretend that you follow a strategy that tells you to recycle referrals who have an average of
under 1.0</p>

<p>You do so and your average goes up. Here’s what it’ll look like:</p>

<center><img src="images/recycle1.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>You’ll have taken care of 1 group of referrals (those who click every once in a while). Good for you.
However, your clicks WILL drop even if you continue to use that strategy. Why is that?
</p>

<p>This is why:</p>

<center><img src="images/recycle2.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>After around one week of using the strategy, that group of referrals will almost be abolished; however, the others increase in numbers. This is why your clicks fall; while you’re paying attention to some of your bad clickers, the others sneak up on you, and make up a large percentage of your total bad clickers. Your average decreases once more, leading you to find another strategy. </p>

<p>How about plain old bad clicks (or group #1)? </p>

<p>You look at your graphs and find many, many of them. Your eyes brighten, and you concentrate on them, recycling as many as you can. Your average skyrockets again, making you happy once more. A week later, they drop again. Here’s why: </p>

<center><img src="images/recycle3.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>Look at group #2, they rose again. You took your attention off of them, and now, they’ve come back to haunt you. It sucks, right? So you find another strategy, continuing to ride the exact same rollercoaster over and over again, all while wasting time and money. </p>

<p>So why am I telling you this? </p>

<p>Because I have a solution. A solution that takes some time, but pays off. </p>

<p>Each of the 4 groups mentioned above are traceable. They can be monitored. Most of you reading this probably think “I don’t feel like getting this all straightened out”. It’s not a problem, I’ve done that for you.</p>

<p>I’ve divided this process into simple steps. Follow them every day and you’ll surely be on your way to a high average – or at least, better than before. </p>

<p>Step 1: </p>
<p>Do this step whenever you feel like it. </p>

<p>1. Make an amount to spend daily according to your referrals. If you have 500 referrals, spend $0.60 on recycling. </p>

<p>2. If you have 2500 referrals, spend $2.00 on recycling. </p>

<p>3. If you want to spend less, spend less. If you want to spend more, spend more, depending on your budget. </p>

<p>Step 2: </p>

<p>Do this step once a week, optional. </p>

<p>1. Sort the referrals by their referral number. The system will actually be sorting them by their usernames, which are hidden, giving you a random list of referrals. </p>

<p>2. Take 10% of your referrals (example: you have 1000 referrals, take 100), preferably the first ones you see and analyze them. Write down the number of referrals on a piece of paper, which are: </p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Good, no need for recycling </li>
	<li>Graph checked, is clicking low clicks (group #1)</li>
	<li>Graph checked, is not clicking enough days for your standards (group #2) </li>
	<li>Graph checked, was a good referral (judging by his average, normally 1.1 to 1.7), but is dying off (group #3)</li>
	<li>Graph checked, did not click for a long time, but was not auto recycled by the system (group #4) </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Grab a calculator and divide the number of referrals in each group by the total number you counted. </p>

<p>This will give you a number similar to 0.XXX ... this is a percentage. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Of the 10% of my 1000 referrals, 15 were in group 1. 15 / 100 = 0.15, or 15% of my referrals</li>
	<li>Once finished, you have an approximation of the bad referrals, and which groups they are in. Use this information to separate which portion of your spending limit (step 1) you will use for each group. </li>
</ul>


<p>Note:</p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Your referrals change very fast. This is why I recommend you do this step every week at least. Then you’ll have an updated approximation.</li>
	<li>Do not use the referral # to sort more than twice in a row. Members you have not recycled the first week will be in the exact same slot the next week, giving you an inaccurate list. Sort them by 2 or 3 the next week, in order to get a change of referrals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3: </p>

<p>Group 1. Referrals who always click 2 ads or less </p>

<p>Go to your rented referrals list and sort them by their average, lowest first. Check their graphs and recycle them if they click 1 or 2 ads per day. Follow your percentages made on Step 2 to base you’re your spending. This is group #1. 
</p>

<p>Example: </p>

<center><img src="images/recycle4.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>Note: </p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li><p>Do not get carried away, even if you find a lot more referrals than you expected. Stick to your limit. </li>
	<li>Take your time, and find the worst of the worst. Being at the top of the list does not necessarily make them the worst NOW. </li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4: </p>

<p>Group 2. Referrals who click their ads only once in a while</p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>There are 2 ways to do this step</li>
	<li>Sort by next payment (lowest first)</li>
	<li>Sort by average (lowest first)</li>
</ul>

<p>Search through the graphs and check who does not click very much. Four ads every 4 days is an average of 1, thus not good. This is group #2. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<center><img src="images/recycle5.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Don’t get carried away, stay by your limit in Step 1 / 2.</li>
	<li>Take your time. Find the worst referrals.</li>
	<li>Don’t recycle referrals who have not clicked for an extensive period of time (like  days or more), and clicked recently. They will be taken care of in the 6th step. </li>
</ul>

<p>Step 5: </p>

<p>Group 3. Referrals who click many ads, get a great average, last around 30 days, and then die off slowly (normally they have a slowly decreasing average of 1.1 to 1.6) </p>

<p>Sort the referrals by average, and go to those over 1.1. Check each graphs, regardless of their clicks, regardless of their time with you (except if they are a few days old), and recycle those who are bad clickers. People normally associate bad clickers with bad averages, which is not the case. Take your time here. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<center><img src="images/recycle6.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Don’t get carried away, stay by your limit in Step 1 / 2.</li>
	<li>Take your time. Find the worst referrals.</li>
	<li>Chances are you’ll have many of these referrals at first. This is why I want you to recycle them LAST (excluding group 4), in order to avoid confusion with group 1 and 2. </li>
</ul>

<p>Step 6: </p>

<p>Group 4. Users who seem to bypass the 14-day free recycle mark by clicking on the 13th or 14th day (the most annoying ones) </p>

<p>There are 2 scenarios here. </p>

<p>Golden and Standards have auto recycle set at 14 days.</p>

<p>Golden packs have auto recycle set from 7 to 12 days, depending on the pack. </p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>If you belong on the second, you can skip this step completely and distribute the funds to the other groups, or replace it with another group of bad clickers you might think of. </li>
	<li>Sort your referrals by last click, today’s clicks first.</li>
	<li>Check the graphs of everyone. Each one who has skipped 9 days or more without clicking, until today, recycle them. They made you lose money, and will make you lose more if you don’t recycle them. </li>
</ul>

<p>Example: </p>

<center><img src="images/recycle7.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>Note: </p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Don’t get carried away, stay by your limit in Step 1 / 2.</li>
	<li>If you can’t find any referrals to recycle for today, look under yesterday’s clickers. Chances are you simply missed a few, make an effort. </li>
</ul>

<p>Final thoughts: </p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Step 2 is not necessary, however, it is highly recommended for people keep track of their profit, or just plain don’t want to get too carried away. </li>
	<li>High averages do not equal profit.</li>
	<li>To get a high average, you need to spend more. You’ll be better off spending $1 per day for a 0.9 average than you would be spending $1.50 for a 1 average. </li>
</ul>

<p>What are you waiting for? My referrals are busy clicking and earning money for me while I am working, jogging or sleeping. If you don’t feel comfortable putting money in first, then work your way up from the free standard membership until you earn enough to upgrade. </p>

<p>Remember, the more time you spend on account management, the more you earn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>1b: Strategy for Golden Members</h2>
<hr class="shortTitle" />
<br />

<p>You should upgrade to Golden when you have 300 rented referrals. That is the maximum number of RR’s a standard member can have. </p>

<p>Projected income for standard members with 300 referrals and average of 2.0:</p>
<ul class="neobux">
	<li>$3.04 per day</li>
	<li>$91.20 per month</li>
	<li>$1109.60 per year</li>
</ul>

<p>Within 30 days of acquiring 300 referrals, you now have the funds to upgrade to golden membership. </p>

<p>Cost of Golden membership: </p>
<p>Per year = $90<br />
Per month = $7.50<br />
Per day = $0.25<br />
</p>

<p>So the cost of being a golden member is $0.25 a day. As long as you make more than that a day, you will be able to profit. You will know you are profiting if your average is 1.0 – in other words, 1.0 is the break even point for you. For standard members it is 1.5</p>

<p>There are 2 renting strategies for golden members. One way is the fast but expensive way, and the other is the slow but cheap way. </p>

<p><b>Strategy A</b>: Each week, buy a 100 referral pack and renew them to 90 days until you have 1000 referrals. Recycle any referral that does not click after 5 days.
</p>

<p><b>Strategy B</b>: Each week buy a 3 referral pack and renew them to 90 days. Recycle after 4 days inactivity. Its simple and efficient. With this you should get an average of about 1 click per referral. 
</p>

<p>Projected earnings</p>

<p>Golden membership with 1000 referrals with an average of 1.0
</p>	

<ul class="neobux"> 
	<li>$10.09 per day    </li>
	<li>$302.70 per month   </li>	
	<li>$3682.85 per year</li>
</ul>

<p>Golden membership with 2000 referrals with an average of 1.0</p>

<ul class="neobux">
	<li>$20.09 per day    </li>	
	<li>$602.70 per month    </li>
	<li>$7332.85 per year</li>
</ul>

<p>As a golden, your goal is to get to 1,000 referrals as soon as possible. Once you get there, it is up to you if you want to upgrade to ultimate right away, or wait for 2,000 referrals. The ultimate upgrade costs $890.00  
</p>

<p>If you choose strategy A, it will take you about 3 months to get the funds to upgrade, and if you choose strategy B, it will take you 2 months. </p>

<p>The strategy for ultimate members is almost the same as golden. Just keep renting referrals in packs of 100 until you reach 4,000 referrals. </p>

<p><b>Keep This in Mind</b></p>

<p>One very important key to success is your daily activity – if you want to be successful on Neobux, you will have to commit to spending a few minutes a day on the site. You need to log in every day to click on ads and manage your RR’s. Skipping days means you are losing money, and this is especially true if you have a lot of referrals! So don’t skip days. </p>
