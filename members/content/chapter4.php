<h1>Chapter 4: Building A List </h1>
<hr color="#25569a" size="4" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, here is a guaranteed way to gain endless direct referrals for the long term... <b>building a mailing list</b>. You've probably heard about internet marketers who make it big by building their list of subscribers, which is essentially their list of customers and loyal followers. </p>

<p>This works extremely well for gaining direct referrals. Unlike the advertising options mentioned above, this is not a one time thing. <i>Building a list will reap you long term rewards, but it requires work and a little bit of money upfront.</i></p>

<p>Before we tell you how to build a list, it may be important to know why this is best strategy for gaining direct referrals. Have you ever signed up to someone else’s mailing list because you wanted to get free information? Then that person or company emailed you maybe every day or every other day to sell you something. But you didn’t mind because you got the information you wanted. That person is building a list. </p>

<p>Now, imagine if you are the owner of a mailing list. Everyday, hundreds, maybe thousands of people are opening their inbox and they see an email from you. Since they trust you they open the email and read what your offer is. Depending on what your offer is, you are going to make lots of money just by sending that one email. But imagine that your subscribers are opening your emails everyday.</p>

<p>Let’s say you today you send an email about a new bux site, called Bux Site A. The email will be sent immediately to your list of 100 subscribers. The typical response rate is 60%, so 60 of your subscribers will read your email, and assuming that half of them join, 30 of them will join Bux Site A as your downlines. Isn’t that exciting? Just by sending 1 email, you get 30 direct referrals overnight.</p>

<p>But of course, results vary depending on what your offer is, how responsive your list is, and what day you sent the email. There are many factors that could affect the results so we will not discuss them. But the above scenario is very possible if you build your list right. </p>

<p><b>No need to “find” referrals</b><br />
Have you ever gotten a direct referral, but you don’t have their email address, so you have no way to contact them whatsoever? But if you follow the ultimate strategy, which is building a list, then you know that your referrals are people in your list. If you want to contact your referrals, just send an announcement to your list, that’s it!
</p>

<p>You don’t need 10 sets of referrals anymore, now it is just one list that you can easily keep track of. Not only that, but people are likely to continue following you. So if Referral A joins you under Neobux, Referral A may also join you under Clixsense, InfinityBux, and PowerBux. That kind of scenario is very possible if you do it right. </p>

<p>Here are top reasons to build a list: 
<ul class="neobux">
	<li>You build a base of loyal followers, which means more and more potential referrals over the long term</li>
 	<li>It’s easier to promote website to people who trust you and want to hear from you </li>
 	<li>Promote multiple websites to the same list, and that means one person can join under you in many sites </li>
 	<li>No need to find referrals to contact them, because you know they are on your list </li>
 	<li>Send one email and get instant referrals overnight </li>
</ul></p>

<p>To set up your auto-pilot referral system, there are some steps you need to take to make that happen. Here is a guideline on building a list. </p>

<p>1. Get an auto responder service like TrafficWave<br />
2. Write newsletters for your list <br />
3. Make a capture page<br />
4. Advertise your capture pages<br />
</p>

<h2>4a. Essential Tools to Build Your List</h2>
 
<p>In order to build a mailing list, you need to have an auto responder, a mailing service that sends out unlimited emails to your people on your behalf. The auto responder we recommend is Traffic Wave. Other services like Constant Contact, or iContact, or Aweber charge you by the size of your list. But with Traffic Wave, the price is the same no matter how big your list gets!</p>

<h2>4b. Write Newsletters for Your List</h2>

<p>Once you have your auto responder mailing list ready, it is time to write some content. Nobody wants to sign up to an empty mailing list, so you will need to have your content ready before you do promotions and marketing.</p>

<p><b>Who is Your Audience?</b><br />
The first thing you need to consider is: who are my subscribers? If you are an actor, then who is your audience? This is the single most important thing to identify before you even launch a business. One big factor in determining your audience is your product. What are you looking to sell? If you sell bicycles, then your audience is probably teenagers and young kids. You need to figure out who is going to buy your product. This is an important factor that can not be overlooked.</p>

<p>Your list is made up of people who are PTC users like yourself. So you will write your newsletters to cater to this group of people. Give some tips on succeeding with PTC’s. Think about this – when you first started with PTC’s, what information would you have wanted?</p>

<p><b>Another Reason to Build Your List</b><br />
It is said that every subscriber that's on your list is worth $1 a month. Considering that fact, how many subscribers do you want to have? If your answer is "as many as possible" then you are the right person who has the right mentality. If you have as much as 1,000 subscribers, then you're making $1,000 a month. Think about the possibilities!</p>

<p><b>Personalize and Brand Yourself</b><br />
When writing newsletters, please consider that your readers are people who don't want to read too much. You're writing an article, not an essay. It is true when they say "less is more". But you are not giving your subscribers less, you are giving them value for their time. If you personalize your newsletters, you are more likely to keep the reader's attention, because people relate to other people.</p>

<p>Being an anonymous salesman may seem "cool", but that is not the best way to build a list. You can still get results being anonymous, but you will not build a loyal base of followers. You can only achieve that by personalizing your newsletters and branding yourself.</p>

<p><b>Keep it Simple, Keep it Interesting</b><br />
If you want people to believe you, you don't need to write a whole essay. Several paragraphs is more than enough to prove your point. What you want to do is keep things simple and have a clear message. Also, keep things interesting by adding pictures - they truly are worth a thousand words. If your newsletters are colorful and fun, then people will look forward to reading your articles, because it doesn't feel like work.</p>

<p>You may consider adding a famous quote, or maybe a silly joke just to keep things light. Let me give you an example. There is an internet marketing named Chase Swift who has several newsletters with thousands of subscribers. He has a short comic at the end of every email. This is what makes him unique and stands out from the crowd, and thus he is branding himself.</p>

<p><b>Be the Master of Your Tools</b><br />
In order to become successful, you must become the master of your tools. How will you build a list if you get stuck in TrafficWave (or some other auto responder you use) and you don’t know how to do certain things? You need to spend a few hours every week learning the system so you can use it efficiently.</p>

<p>Luckily for you, TrafficWave has training videos designed to teach you how to use their service. <br />
	<?=outsideLink('http://www.trafficwave.net/videos/'); ?>
</p>

<p>At the very least, you should learn the fundamentals of TrafficWave. After all, it is a business tool that you are going to use over and over. So you might as well master it now so you can have an easier time in the future.</p>

<p><b>Don’t Sell Too Much</b><br />
What you want to do is ask your subscribers to join your PTC sites as your referral several times over the course of the newsletter. Since they trust you and like you, they will join under you. <i>They will trust you if you give them free information</i>. This will happen automatically as they receive your newsletters.</p>

<p>Imagine having that kind of influence with your list, a group of people who trust you and will follow whatever you do. Once you have your audience, you can advertise as many sites as you want. But don’t sell too often, or people will get annoyed. If they are annoyed, then they will un-subscribe from you and you are guaranteed to fail.</p>

<p>What you want to do is soft selling – a technique developed by internet marketing gurus. If you just give people a link, then it is obvious you just want to sell, and people will be turned off by that. I will give you 2 examples of selling, one is bad selling, and the other, the correct way, is soft selling.</p>

<p>How NOT to Sell Something</p>

<div class="textBox" id="textBox1" style="width: 400px"><h2>Bad Selling</h2>
<p>Hey there **First Name**</p>

<p>Join my sites now! Clixsense is the best PTC ever! You will make lots of money $$ guaranteed, join today!</p>

<p>http://www.clixsense.com/?r=username <br />
http://www.infinitybux.com/?r=username<br /> 
http://www.powerfulbux.com/?r=username</p>
</div>

<p>Clearly this person just wants to build a downline, and he does not care about you or your goals. Only a few people, if any, will actually click on the link and join the sites he mentions. This is very spam-like, and most people will just ignore it, or worse, maybe the email filters will mark it as spam, and it is never seen by human eyes.</p>

<p>"Soft Selling" – Selling the Right Way</p>

<div class="textBox" id="textBox2" style="width: 500px"><h2>Soft Selling</h2>
<p>Hey there **First Name**</p>

<p>I have joined many PTC’s but only a few were any good, so I wanted to show you
a few of those sites that I highly recommend. Have you checked out Clixsense yet? It is one of the best PTC’s in the industry, you can earn from 8 levels of referrals, and there is no limit to how many referrals you can have. Earn from 0.001 to 0.01 per click.</p>

<p>I’d appreciate it if you joined on my team. Here’s my link:</p>

<p>http://www.clixsense.com/?r=username</p>

<p>By the way, here are some other great sites to check out: <br />
http://www.infinitybux.com/?r=username <br />
http://www.powerfulbux.com/?r=username</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br />
Your Name</p>
</div>

<p>See the difference? One person is just selling you stuff, while the other person is building a list. Soft selling is the art of selling without it feeling like a sale, even though it is. This person took the time to tell you about themselves, which builds credibility and trust. And he also gave you information about Clixsense before he asks you to join. It shows that he cares about what he does and he wants you to be informed. </p>

<p>As you are writing your newsletters keep these points in mind. Do not use bad selling (spamming) or you will fail and waste your time and money. </p>

<p>One more thing to consider is that people are always looking for the latest information from the PTC World. If you give recent information and keep them up to date, they will be happy. And if your list is happy, you will happy. </p>

<p>Remember these tips</p>

<p>Here is a checklist for writing newsletters. 
<ul class="neobux">
	<li>Give people free information and they will flock to you like flies </li>
 	<li>Don’t sell too much or too little, use soft selling so you don’t sound like a spammer</li> 
 	<li>When you ask someone to join a PTC, give them details such as cost per click, cash out limit, and referral rates</li> 
 	<li>Building a list takes time, but the long term rewards will be worth it</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>The Magic Number</b><br />
Besides the content of the newsletters, the timing is also important. According to research, the optimum number of emails to send per week is (3) emails. Of course, this is only a guideline, it might not be true for everyone. For example, in the first week someone signs up, you may want to send more emails (1 per day, for example) because you want to build a relationship right away and lock the prospect in. If they trust you and regard you as an authority they are less likely to un-subscribe. </p>

<p><b>Never Ignore the Subject Line</b><br />
As a list builder, one thing you need to focus on are open rates. Simply put, it is a % of people who open your emails. If your list has 100 people, and 20 people read your emails, your open rate is 20%. In the first week, the open rate is very high (like 90% to 100%), and it decreases as time passes on. After 3 to 4 weeks, the open rate drops to 20% to 30%. Why spend time writing a newsletter if no one is going to open it? In order to increase your open rate you need to focus on the subject line. </p>

<p>The subject line is what catches your reader’s attention – it is something you can’t ignore. If you make the email personal then they will open it. Put the prospect’s name in the email, first and last if possible. Then, ask them a question they will want to know the answer to. Questions will raise their curiosity, which leads them to clicking on the email. </p>

<p>Something like this is acceptable: </p>

<div class="textBox" id="textBox2" style="width: 500px">

<p><b>Sell the NUS Course with Your List</b></p>

<p>To properly utilize a list you need to build a relationship with your list. Give them free information from time to time, and they will trust you more because you are saving them a lot of time by providing relevant information about PTC’s. Imagine having that kind of influence with your people that you sell anything you want. Well, if you build a relationship with them and do soft selling you can achieve those kinds of results.</p>

<p>To make more money with the list you already have, become an affiliate and sell the Neobux Ultimate Strategy 
to them. You have bought and benefited from the information, so why not let other people have the same information, while you are making money from it. It’s a win-win situation no matter how you look at it.  </p>

<p>Now you have 2 ways to make money, PTC referral earnings and earnings from NUS sales.</p>

	<img src="images/chapter4-7.jpg" class="clickable" />
</center>

<p>Now let’s get to the features of the editor. Please see screenshot below for reference. We are interested in only certain areas.</p>

<p>1. Subject line<br />
They say that the subject line is the most important line in the whole email, and for good reason. </p>

<p>Everybody’s trying to sell something online, so they’re all sending emails to each other. So the average person’s inbox is pretty full. So you only have a few seconds to get people’s attention. If your subject line is no good, then people won’t read it, and your email will go to waste. </p>

<p>There are many ways to get people’s attention with the subject line. </p>

<p>2. Add token<br />
Click on this to select from a number of tokens available. Select the person’s name, the first name or the full name, to use in the subject line. When people see their own name, they will pay attention, thinking you are talking to them directly. </p>

<center>
	<img src="images/chapter4-8.jpg" class="clickable" />
</center>

<p>Other ideas to make an engaging subject line:</p>

<p>Ask a question that makes people curious<br />
Ex. “How much have YOU made so far?”</p>

<p>List X number of things they need to know<br />
Ex. “What are the top 3 mistakes people are making?”</p>

<p>Mention a popular topic and ask for their opinion<br />
Ex. “Is Neobux using bots or not? We want your opinion!”</p>

<p>3. Maximize & Minimize button </p>

<p>Click on the maximize button to make the editor full screen. You can switch back and forth at your convenience by clicking the same button. It will be easier for you to work on full screen instead of a tiny space in the editor. </p>

<p>4. Tokens<br />
Just like the subject line, you can add tokens to your newsletter. Remember the URL tokens you entered into the campaign? This is where you’d use them. </p>

<p>5. Link button<br /> 
To add a hyperlink to your newsletter, click on this button and just fill in the URL and other necessary fields. </p>

<p>6. Headline<br />
The headline should reflect the topic discussed in the body text</p>

<p>7. Email body <br />
You need to write engaging and interesting content. People are suckers for free information, so if you become the source for free information, people will like you and trust you. They will see you as an expert and will treat you like one.</p>

<p>Once you have that kind of credibility, you can promote anything you want to them, and they will happily join your PTC sites. </p>

<center>
	<img src="images/chapter4-9.jpg" />

<p>Once you do this step, your newsletters are now live. Congratulations! </p>

<p>Here are some pointers to follow when writing content:</p>

<p>1. Don't spam - this annoys people<br />
2. Don't over-sell - people will ignore you<br />
3. Give free information<br />
4. The bigger your list, the more referrals you get
