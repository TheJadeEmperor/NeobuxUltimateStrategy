<h1>Chapter 2: Free Direct Referrals</h1>
<hr color="#25569a" size="4" />

<p>In any Neobux, direct referrals are 50% of the equation of success. In most PTC's, direct referrals are 90% 
of your success. Direct referrals tend to be more reliable than rented referrals, as they are more likely to be active clickers. Plus, you don’t have to pay to keep them – you will make money as long as they keep clicking – so imagine if some of your referrals stay active for months, maybe even years. 
</p>

<p>You should get as many direct referrals as you can – up to the maximum that your PTC allows. Since you don’t pay to keep them, they will earn money for you everyday. Then you can use that money to rent referrals and renew referrals. 
</p>

<p>PTC’s have different rules around direct referrals, so make sure you understand the rules carefully before advertising on a mass scale. For example, in Neobux, you cannot get any DR’s until 30 days after registration – all attempts before that will fail! </p>

<h2>2a. Use Traffic Exchanges</h2>

<p>A guaranteed, surefire way to get direct referrals for free is to use Traffic Exchanges. In a nutshell, this is how a traffic exchange works. You surf websites and earn credits, and these credits get traffic to your website. In most traffic exchanges, 1 credit equals 1 view, but it varies from program to program. </p>

<p>The reason you need to join a traffic exchange is because you need a way to consistently promote your referral links so you can gain referrals. Other methods, such as getting people on Facebook, require too much work and take too long to see immediate results. Traffic Exchanges allow you to gain referrals in a predictable way, without the need to prospect on Facebook or do some crazy advertising. </p>

<p>Maximizing Traffic Exchanges</p>

<p>Spending 30 minutes a day surfing on <a href="http://a.easyhits4u.com/splash1.php?ref=theemperor">Traffic Exchanges</a> dramatically increases your direct referral count. To maximize surfing, use tabbed browsing on your browser. </p>

<p>You should use EasyHits4U and other traffic exchanges at the same time. You can also click ads on Neobux and other PTC’s as you are surfing the traffic exchanges. That way, you get everything done within those 30 minutes. We are building multiple branches of the tree at the same time. </p>

<p>If you are too lazy to surf for credits, there are alternate options for you. You can upgrade your account and get anywhere from 1000 to 2000 credits per month. Also, you can refer others to the traffic exchanges, and earn a % of the credits they earn. For more information, join EasyHits4U read about their referral program. 
</p>

<p>For best results, do not promote your referral links. But what do you mean? Isn’t the whole point to gain referrals? 
</p>

<p>We say that because in a traffic exchange, you only 15 to 30 seconds to get people’s attention. So you need to make those 15 to 30 seconds count. They need to see what your offer is at a glance, because if they are not interested, they will move on, and you will lose them forever. For best results, advertise your capture page. For more info on capture pages, please see the following chapters.  </p>


<h2>2b. PTC Forums & Referral Exchange Forums</h2>

<p>A second option for getting free referrals is to do PTC Exchange Forums. These forums are made of like minded people like you, who want to get referrals, but do not want to spend money.</p>

<p>It's a place where people can share their favorite sites and make "deals" with one another. You join my site, I will join yours. The idea is "You scratch my back and I scratch your back."</p>

<p>This person mentions that he's online a lot - which means he'll be an active user. It is a very key ingredient to get people to make deals with you. Who'd you rather make a deal with - someone who is <b>active</b>, or someone who is <b>not?</b> Also note that this person uses the same username for all programs, so that managing many sites is easier.</p>

<center><img src="images/post2.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>This person clearly knows what he's doing. He has a list of sites that he wants to join, and a list of
sites that he wants referrals for. The list is neat and organized and easy to read. </p>

<p>Here's some general rules for posting: 
<ul>
    <li>Use a compelling subject line -- making it eye catching and unique from all the other posts. </li>

    <li>Be brief and straight to the point. State that your intention is to be active in any site you join. List all your sites one by one.</li>

    <li>Put your favorite site at the top of the list, followed by second favorite, in decreasing order of preference. Use banners in your posts to get people's attention.  </li>
    <li>State that you are going to be active. Everybody likes active referrals. </li>

</ul>
