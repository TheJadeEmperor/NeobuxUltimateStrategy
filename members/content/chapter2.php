<h1>Chapter 2: Free Direct Referrals</h1>
<hr color="#25569a" size="4" />

<p>In any Neobux, direct referrals are 50% of the equation of success. In most PTC's, direct referrals are 90% 
of your success. Direct referrals tend to be more reliable than rented referrals, as they are more likely to be active clickers. Plus, you don’t have to pay to keep them – you will make money as long as they keep clicking – so imagine if some of your referrals stay active for months, maybe even years. 
</p>

<p>You should get as many direct referrals as you can – up to the maximum that your PTC allows. Since you don’t pay to keep them, they will earn money for you everyday. Then you can use that money to rent referrals and renew referrals. 
</p>

<p>PTC’s have different rules around direct referrals, so make sure you understand the rules carefully before advertising on a mass scale. For example, in Neobux, you cannot get any DR’s until 30 days after registration – all attempts before that will fail! </p>

<h2>2a. Use Traffic Exchanges</h2>

<p>A guaranteed, surefire way to get direct referrals for free is to use Traffic Exchanges. In a nutshell, this is how a traffic exchange works. You surf websites and earn credits, and these credits get traffic to your website. In most traffic exchanges, 1 credit equals 1 view, but it varies from program to program. </p>

<p>The reason you need to join a traffic exchange is because you need a way to consistently promote your referral links so you can gain referrals. Other methods, such as getting people on Facebook, require too much work and take too long to see immediate results. Traffic Exchanges allow you to gain referrals in a predictable way, without the need to prospect on Facebook or do some crazy advertising. </p>

<p>Maximizing Traffic Exchanges</p>

<p>Spending 30 minutes a day surfing on <a href="http://a.easyhits4u.com/splash1.php?ref=theemperor">Traffic Exchanges</a> dramatically increases your direct referral count. To maximize surfing, use tabbed browsing on your browser. </p>

<p>You should use EasyHits4U and other traffic exchanges at the same time. You can also click ads on Neobux and other PTC’s as you are surfing the traffic exchanges. That way, you get everything done within those 30 minutes. We are building multiple branches of the tree at the same time. </p>

<p>If you are too lazy to surf for credits, there are alternate options for you. You can upgrade your account and get anywhere from 1000 to 2000 credits per month. Also, you can refer others to the traffic exchanges, and earn a % of the credits they earn. For more information, join EasyHits4U read about their referral program. 
</p>

<p>For best results, do not promote your referral links. But what do you mean? Isn’t the whole point to gain referrals? 
</p>

<p>We say that because in a traffic exchange, you only 15 to 30 seconds to get people’s attention. So you need to make those 15 to 30 seconds count. They need to see what your offer is at a glance, because if they are not interested, they will move on, and you will lose them forever. For best results, advertise your capture page. For more info on capture pages, please see the following chapters.  </p>


<h2>2a. Use Downline Builders</h2>

<p>A second option for getting direct referrals is to use Downline Builders, aka Team Builders. In a nutshell, this is how a downline builder works. You and I make a contract; you join site A as my referral, and I will join site B as your referral. The contract is effectively so as long as we are both active; either one of us can cancel the contract if the terms are broken. </p>

<p>What downline builders do we recommend?</p>

<p><a href='http://www.downlinerefs.com/?ref=theemperor' target='_blank'>Downlinerefs.com</a> has a large user base, and that means a lot of potential referrals for you. At the beginning, you will need some credits in order to promote your site. There are 2 ways to earn credits: by joining other sites (fulfilling a contract) and by paying for credits.  </p>

<p>At first it may seem like you are doing more work to achieve some results, but it is actually a good incentive to get people to be clicking daily. Plus, when someone has already clicked for 20 to 30 days, they are “obligated” to continue clicking, since they are used to the site. </p>
