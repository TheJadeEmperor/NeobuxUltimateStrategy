<h2>3a. Direct Referrals for PTC’s </h2>

<p>To advertise other PTC sites, we recommend using banner advertising on none other than Neobux. That’s right, Neobux has millions of members and counting. That's a lot of daily traffic! </p>

<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:advertisements@neobux.com">advertisements@neobux.com</a>, inquiring about banner advertising. They will reply with an email that looks like this: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prices above are for 468 x 60 banners. The 768 x 90 banners cost double. In addition to the above prices, you can ask for your banner to be displayed in the ad frame, which is the top area of the advertisement page. These prices are 4 times more expensive, but will produce even more results. </p>

<p>Now, all you have to do is send them the money and reply with your banner details. Then, once your banner is up, start counting the referrals as they will come pouring in! The newer the PTC, the more referrals you will get. People in this industry are always excited to join new PTC’s, trying to get ahead of the game. </p>

<p>Using this technique alone we received over <b>2,000</b> referrals in EasyHits4U. It will work for any website that has a referral system, whether it is a traffic exchange or PTC. The sheer number of referrals speak for themselves. Although Neobux banner ads cost some money, the results are extraordinary and is worth every penny.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this is how you advertise on Neobux:<br />

2. When you receive the email reply, decide which ad package you’d like to buy, then 
send the payment through Paypal or Alertpay<br />

<h2 id="directReferrals">3b. Direct Referrals for Neobux</h2>

<p>Getting direct referrals for Neobux is more difficult than other PTC’s. We do not recommend advertising Neobux on other bux sites. Why, you ask? First of all, Neobux is the first bux site that most people join before joining other bux sites. If they are already on a bux site, chances are they are in Neobux, and advertising on that site will be a waste of money and effort. Because Neobux is so famous, millions of people are already in it. This can be a blessing and a curse, since Neobux has a lot of credibility, but since so many people are in it, it is hard to get referrals.</p>

<p>What I discovered is that there certain websites that have over 100K members that have never heard of Neobux. These sites give you affordable advertising options, so they are a goldmine for finding direct referrals.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Using Linkrand</b></p>

<center><img src="images/linkgrandOrder.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>When you go to linkgrand.com, you will see this screen. It is very simple to use, what you see is what you get. Put your link text into the field, and in the link url, put in your referral link. Then, pick the funding option that best suits your budget. You can also enter a different amount if you want to spend more money. </p>

<p>If you want special features, they will cost more money, but will give you more targeted results. If you choose to target by country, we recommend that you choose India, Bangladesh, or any European country. You should choose countries that have a lower currency than the USA, because they think that Neobux will pay a lot. </p>

<p>You can also choose to auto-renew your order. If you have a budget to work with, this option will give you referrals on auto-pilot. Set and forget! You may cancel the auto-renew at any point from your paypal account. </p>

<p>And the best thing about linkgrand is that you do not need to register to buy an advertisement! You can do this all from the home page – and set up your referral system in less than a minute!</p>

<p>Referrals on Steroids</p>

<p>
This strategy is only for those who have a budget. If you want to get tons of referrals overnight, then used Neobux fixed advertisements. As you recall, there are several classes of ads in Neobux:  micro ads, standard exposure ads, and then there are ads you see everyday. </p>

<p>These are fixed ads. The ones in orange are fixed ads that show up everyday, they are companies that have made a deal with Neobux. You can order fixed ads for a certain amount of time; they are the ones in purple.</p>


<center><img src="images/neoFixedAds.jpg" class="clickable" /></center>

<p>Since Neobux has 3 million members and growing, hundreds of thousands of visitors log in everyday to click ads. So it is a guarantee that you will get anywhere from 80,000 to 110,000 views to your ad on a given day. The pricing for fixed ads is below:</p>

		<td>$665.00</td>

	<tr>

		<td>$90</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>30 days / 1 month</td>	
		<td>$2550.00</td>
		<td>$85</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>60 days / 2 months</td>	
		<td>$4800.00</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>90 days / 3 months</td>	
		<td>$6750.00</td>
		<td>	$75</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Buying a fixed ad will give you referrals on steroids! You will get 80 to 100 direct referrals (and more) overnight! But this strategy is very expensive. If you are on a budget do not buy fixed ads! We mentioned earlier that you should not spend money you cannot afford to lose. However, if you do have an extra $100 to spare, and want to take your PTC business to the next level, then consider using fixed ads.</p>
