<p>I gotta tell you, I'm pretty excited about this hack. In the following post 
I'm going to show you a way you can get $100 worth of bitcoins and end up 
with $125 in bitcoins! But before I explain the process there are a few 
limitations you need to be aware of.</p>

<p>First, this will only work if you have a bank account in one of these countries:</p>

<p>Austria<br />
Belgium<br />
Bulgaria<br />
Canada<br />
Croatia<br />
Cyprus<br />
Czech Republic<br />
Denmark<br />
Finland<br />
France<br />
Greece<br />
Hungary<br />
Ireland<br />
Italy<br />
Latvia<br />
Malta<br />
Netherlands<br />
Norway<br />
Poland<br />
Portugal<br />
Romania<br />
Slovakia<br />
Spain<br />
Sweden<br />
Switzerland<br />
United Kingdom<br />
United States</p>

<br />

<p>Second, you can't be an existing Coinbase customer - Meaning you have to be 
    completely new to Coinbase. Even if your country isn't on the list, you can still try to register. 
    If you cannot register, however, then this will not work for you, unfortunately. 
    Please do NOT email me about this - this is a Coinbase restriction. </p>

<p>If you can register, great. This is what you need to do. Please read these instructions carefully.</p>

<p>1. You must register through this link - <b><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/TheEmperor">https://www.coinbase.com/join/TheEmperor</a></b></p>

<p><u>2. Connect your bank account and buy at least $100 worth of bitcoins</u></p>

<p><i>3. Once the bitcoins arrive in your account, contact us and state your Coinbase username and your Coinbase Bitcoin address.</i> </p>

<p><u>4. Once payment is verified, we will send $25 to your account within 24 hours. Thus, you end up with $125! You can then do whatever you want with your money.</u> </p>
 
<br />

<p><b>Why are we giving you back money?</b></p>

<p>Simply put, we get a commission for each new customer we bring into Coinbase, so we decided to split this commission with our subscribers in hopes of getting as many people on board as possible. It's a win win situation.</p>

<p>*Note: It's important to understand that sometimes Coinbase will not approve you as eligible for a commission and in that case we won't be able to pay you back. However, based on past experience 95% of our referrals get paid back. </p>

<p>*Note: Coinbase is expanding rapidly to many countries. If you cannot register from your country, then this promotion does not apply to you. Please do NOT contact us about it. </p>

<p>It might take some time for your purchase to go through. Just be patient. We will send $25 in Bitcoins once your purchase is approved. Once again - this is a time sensitive promotion. We don't know how long Coinbase is giving out these bonuses. So get on board now while you can!</p>
