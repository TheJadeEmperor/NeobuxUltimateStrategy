<p>Today we are going to cover some fundamentals of managing your Neobux account. Often times, people join Neobux with no game plan, and they have no idea what to do. There is so much to do that it can be confusing and daunting. That's why we are giving you the following pointers:  </p>


<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>The free way is the slow way</b></span></p>

<p>When I first got started Neobux, I looked at it as a way to make money without spending any money. That's great if you are a patient person, but the down side is that if you do not invest anything, <i>it will take a while for you to earn money</i>, especially with the low earnings for standard members. If you put in <b>even $5.00</b> and rent some referrals, you will get ahead of the game a lot faster than others. </p> 



<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Renting Referrals & Managing Referrals</b></span></p>

<p>You should rent referrals as soon as they are available. To put it simply, the more referrals you have, the more money you will make. The most successful members have thousands of referrals they manage (even tens of thousands). You need to learn
the fundamentals of managing referrals, such as recycling and renewing. </p>

<p>If you want to know if you are profiting, Neobux has a number system for you. If a referral's average is less than 1.0 you are losing money, if it's 1.0, you are breaking even, and if it it's greater than 1.0, you are profiting. </p>

<p>We have material written for you regarding managing referrals. For beginners, you can check out our Neobux Basics ebook. For experienced users, you can browse our blog for advanced strategies to manage your Neobux account. </p>

<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Get Direct Referrals ASAP</b></span></p>

<p>Direct referrals are free to keep, and they make you money every day, so you should get as many as you can, until you get the max number, according to your membership level. Just like rented referrals, direct referrals need to be replaced if they are not active. </p>

<p><img src="<?=$imgDir?>refs/dr.jpg" alt="Neobux Golden Member" /></p>

<p>However, for most people, finding direct referrals is a challenge. The Neobux Ultimate Strategy is a course that will teach you how to get direct referrals forever, and you will never run out! </p>

<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Prepare for Golden Membership</b></span> &nbsp; <img src="<?=$imgDir?>upgrade/golden.png" alt="Neobux Golden Member" /></p>

<p>The Golden Membership will be your first major upgrade, so you will need to prepare for it from the beginning. Do not upgrade until you've had at least 300 rented referrals. When you are Golden, you can only rent at certain times of the day, thus making it much harder for you. </p>

<p>Upgrade only when you have $120 in your balance. The Golden upgrade costs $90 and the $30 goes towards account management. </p>


<p>To learn about different upgrades after Golden, go to our comprehensive guide here:

<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>The Neobux Adalert Chrome Addon</span></b></p>

<p>The Neobux toolbar called Adalert is a feature that's been around for years, yet it is the most under-rated and underused feature. It lets you know when new ads are available for clicking. You can stay informed throughout the day and make more money with this toolbar. All you have to do is keep your browser open and keep your eye on the toolbar. 
</p>

<p><img src="<?=$imgDir?>toolbar/toolbarBrowser.jpg" alt="Neobux Ad Alert | Neobux Chrome Addon" /></p>

<p>Adalert takes up no space at all and is easy to install. Within your Neobux account, find this link. </p>

<p><img src="<?=$imgDir?>toolbar/toolbarLink.jpg" alt="Neobux Ad Alert | Neobux Chrome Addon" /></p>


<p>Find the right version of Adalert for your browser. It is available for all major browsers, and the toolbar will be automatically updated (depending on your browser's settings) so that you'll always have the latest version. We recommend using Chrome and definitely <b>not</b> using Internet Explorer.</p>

</p>
 
<p>You'll also have your updated balance at the distance of a single click without disturbing you from what you're doing on your computer.</p>



<p><img src="<?=$imgDir?>toolbar/toolbarPopup.jpg" alt="Neobux Ad Alert | Neobux Chrome Addon" /></p>

<p>There are ads on Neobux that are available for a short amount of time. These are different than the daily purple/orange ads you see. By having this chrome add-on, you will always know when these new ads are available and can take action right away. Many Neobux users have reported that using this chrome add-on increased their earnings by up to 20%. </p>

<p>Try it out because you have nothing to lose. If you don't like it, you can always uninstall at the click of a button. </p>




<p><?=$X_img?> &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 20px"><b>Cashing Out</span></b></p>

<p>Finally, this is the part we've been working for. Once you have a clicking army, you will be profiting. Make sure you save enough money for rental fees and such. If you'd like, you can save some money for future upgrades (to ultimate). You may only cashout once per week, so factor that in your math. <i>Have fun earning! </i></p>
