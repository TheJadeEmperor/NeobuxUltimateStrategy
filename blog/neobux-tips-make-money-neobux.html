<p>Today we are going to 
cover some fundamental tips on succeeding with Neobux.</p>

<p><b>1) The Free Way is the Slow Way</b></p>

<p>When I first started Neobux, I looked at it as a way to make money without spending any money. 
That's great if you are a patient person, but the down side is that if you do not invest anything, 
<i>it will take a while for you to earn money</i>, especially if you make 0.001 per click. 
If you put in <b>$5.00 to $10.00</b> initially and rent some referrals, you will get ahead of the game a lot 
faster than others.</p> 

<p><b>2) Maintaining Rented Referrals</b></p>

<p>Rented Referrals (RR) is the name of the game at Neobux. Simply put, the more RR's you have,
the more money you will make. You want to make sure you keep whatever ones you have. 
Turn on <b>auto-renew</b> and leave it on.</p>

<p>To monitor your referral's activities, Neobux has a color system. This system lets you 
know whether you are <i>profiting</i> (green), <i>breaking even</i> (yellow), or <i>losing money</i> (red). 
Constantly recycle inactive RRs. Recycling costs 0.07 and it is better to recycle in the 
long run. </p>

<p>With the RR's on auto-renew, you are paying for the upkeep of these referrals. You want to 
constantly recycle until you have a high average (2.0 or higher). For standard members, 
<i>anything less than 2.0 means you are losing money</i>. Keep recycling until you have a team of 
active users. I recommend recycling anyone that has not clicked in <b>4 days</b>.</p>

<p><b>3) Build up for Golden</b></p>

<p>When you reach 250 RR's, keep autopay on. It will pay for your RR's and save you 10% on 
rental fees. When you can afford it, renew the RR's for 90 days, and disable the autopay. 
This will save you <b>20% to 30%</b> in fees over time. Continue to build up your RR's until 
you have 300.</p>

<p>Do not upgrade to golden until you've had at least 300 RR's. It will be tough to get RR's when 
you are golden, as you can only rent at certain times of the day. Our recommendation is: 
when you have $120 in your account, upgrade. Golden costs $90, and the rest of the $30 goes 
towards rentals.</p>

<p><b>4) Direct Referrals</b></p>

<p>Anybody who has used PTC's will agree that direct referrals are the way to go because
they are completely free to keep! Finding direct referrals, however, is a challenge
for many. Our ebook will cover strategies - <i>free ways and paid ways</i> - to get an army
of direct referrals.</p>

<p><b>5) Cashing Out</b></p>

<p>Finally, the part we've been working for. Once you have a clicking army, 
you will be profiting. Make sure you save enough money for rental fees and such. 
If you'd like, you can save some money for future upgrades (to ultimate). You may 
only cashout once per week, so factor that in your math. <i>Have fun earning!</i></p>
