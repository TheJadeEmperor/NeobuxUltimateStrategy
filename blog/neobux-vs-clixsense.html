<p>Today I wanted to compare in detail 2 of the top PTC Programs on the internet. I think this post is long overdue, since both Neobux and Clixsense have been in business for more than 7 years. They are without a doubt, leaders and trustworthy models in an industry full of liars and scams. </p>

<h2>Pay per click</h2>

<p>In Neobux, standard members earn 0.001 per click and up to 0.01 per click on extended ads. For Clixsense, members earn 0.001 to 0.005 per click, and up to 0.02 on extended ads. Extended ads are ones that you must look at for 60 seconds or more. Extended ads appear more frequently on Clixsense than Neobux, which makes Clixsense a better use of time. 
</p>

<p>Earnings on Neobux are very limited for standard members, which makes it harder to earn money for Neobux. </p>


<p>What about referral clicks? In Neobux, you get 0.005 per referral click, whereas in Clixsense you get 0.008 per click. In both programs, referral clicks are worth more when you upgrade. Clearly, the per click rate for Clixsense is better, and this program wins in this category. </p>

<h2>Rented Referrals</h2>

Only Neobux allows you to rent referrals. Clixsense does not have this feature. Many members have been able to rent referrals without putting in any of their own money, and build a huge army of referrals, and make a nice amount of money every month.  


<h2>Browser toolbars</h2>

<p>Both PTC programs have the option of letting you install a toolbar, with the purpose of letting you see ads throughout the day that you would've normally missed. They both work the same way - as you are browsing the internet, you will see if ads are available, and you can click on the toolbar to login and view the ad.</p>


<h2>Forums & Customer Support</h2>


<p>Both programs have forums that are strictly moderated and spam free. You can post payment proofs, tell your success stories, or ask a question to other members.</p>

<p>Both programs offer fast customer support. You can email them and ask them questions or ask for help
recovering a lost password. </p>


<h2>Not Being Active</h2>

<p>If you have a Neobux account that isn't active for 90 days, your account will be deleted forever...with no
exceptions. With Clixsense however, the admin is more understanding, and even if your account is banned
there is a chance it can be restored. With Neobux, the chances of recovering a banned account is very low.
Recovering a deleted account is impossible, so don't even bother. On top of that, Clixsense does not
have rules about not being active. </p>

<p>In this category, Clixsense wins by a landslide. </p>


<h2>Which One Pays Faster?</h2>


<p>The payment system varies between these 2 programs. In Neobux, the minimum cashout is $2. And for every cashout after that, the threshold increases by $1 until you reach $10. After that, every payment threshold is $10. For example, your payments may look like this: $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $10, $10, etc...</p>

<p>All payments are instant - there is no wait time whatsoever. Let's say you cash out from your balance right now. You can check your Paypal account 1 or 2 minutes later and the money will be there. This is a unique Neobux feature that no other program has. </p>

<p>The payment structure for Clixsense is a bit complicated, and I will explain it below. The threshold for standard members is $8, and for upgraded members is $6. All payments are made on Wednesday afternoons, so it doesn't matter when you cashout. 
</p>

<p>Both programs let you cashout via the following methods: Paypal, Payza, and Neteller. Clixsense has an extra processor called Paytoo. I have tried using Paytoo, but I found it to be not user friendly and difficult to use. It's a really crappy payment processor...and there's no real reason to use Paytoo unless if you have no other way to receive money. </p>

<p>Clixsense also gives you the option to get paid by check. You must cashout before the 10th of the month to receive your check within the same month. Receiving a check is really convenient, and it's what makes Clixsense unique. </p>

<p>I personally prefer to receive checks because it skips the hassle of having to use a processor like Paypal/Payza/Neteller. The fee for checks is $1.00, which is lower than the other processors.</p>

<p>No other PTC programs has this feature, which makes Clixsense legit and trustworthy. </p>

<p>It is hard to decide a winner in this category, since they are both so good. One lets you have instant payments, the other lets you receive checks straight to your home.  </p>

<h2>Tasks and Surveys</h2>

This is a major thing now in Neobux and Clixsense. Both programs let you complete tasks or surveys for the chance to make some extra money. Now you can earn more than just a few cents a day clicking on ads. 

<p> They pay anywhere from 0.01 to a few dollars per task completed. You get NeoPoints or NeoCoins for each task you complete, and those points can be used for various things to enhance your account.</p>

<p>Some offers will credit immediately, while others may take up to a few days. Both Neobux and Clixsense 
have a variety of tasks and surveys, which makes it difficult to compare which one is better.</p>



<h2>Conclusion - which one is better?</h2>

<p>That's a really difficult decision to make, since both programs have their strong points. With Neobux, you rent referrals and build up your army so they make money for you, which you will use to rent more referrals. Earnings are slow build gradual. And best of all, for you cheap people, you don't have to invest your own money. </p>

<p>Neobux is good for you if you don't have money to invest, but have a lot of patience and enjoy doing math. Those who are serious earners have 1000s of referrals and have to scroll through pages and pages of referrals to decide which ones to recycle and renew. </p>

<p>Clixsense is generally more newb-friendly and a faster earner. You can get direct referrals, which you can do from day 1, and earn even more. You have to build your team and teach them how to use this program. Clixsense feels much like a MLM, since you invest time in your downlines, and you can receive checks. 
</p>

<p>I suggest you try both and see which style you prefer. That is my comparison of Neobux and Clixsense. Hopefully this post shed some light on the differences and similiarities between the top 2 PTC's in the industry, and help you make a decision as to which one to join. </p>
