<p>Rented Referrals (RR) is the name of the game at Neobux. Simply put, the more active RR's you have,
the more money you will make. You want to make sure you keep whatever ones you have. 
When you get enough money turn on <b>auto-renew</b> and leave it on.</p>

<p>To monitor your referral's activities, Neobux has a color system. This system lets you 
know whether you are <i>profiting</i> (green), <i>breaking even</i> (yellow), or <i>losing money</i> (red). 
Constantly recycle inactive RRs. Recycling costs 0.07 per referral and it is better to recycle in the 
long run.</p> 

<p>With the RR's on auto-renew, you are paying for the upkeep of these referrals. You want to 
constantly recycle until you have a high average (2.0 or higher). For standard members, 
<i>anything less than 2.0 means you are losing money</i>. Keep recycling until you have a team of 
active users. I recommend recycling anyone that has not clicked in <b>4 days</b>. </p>

<p>*Note: This is true for upgraded members. In 2011, Neobux reduced the earning rate for
standard members to $0.001 per click, drastically reducing their earnings. Because of these
lower earnings, standard members should recycle conservatively and use auto-recycle more often. </p>

<p>These are just general guidelines to follow. There is no one size fits all answer for recycling,
it is something you need to do constantly and see if it gets you better results. You need to
recgonize referral's clicking patterns so you can identify which ones are good and which ones are bad.

your clicking average. To get the ebook right away, go to our <a href="./">sales page</a>. </p>


<h3>What is Auto-Renew and why should you use it?</h3>
Firstly, auto pay only works if the referral: <br>
*Has 20 days remaining <br>
*Is actively clicking</p>

<p>Each time a referral clicks, 1 day will be added to their expiration date. So, 
you are automatically paying for them from your rental balance. It is useful if you 
have a lot of referrals and don't want to renew them. Your referrals will not expire as long as 
they are clicking, and you will save <b>10%</b> in renewal fees over time.</p>


<p>AutoRenew is a relatively new feature in Neobux - the way it work is simple - you can
choose when you would like to renew a RR, and for how long. For example, you can
renew a RR for 30 days just 3 days before the RR's expiration date.</p>

<p>The discounts are as follows: <br>
15 days - no discount <br>
30 days - 5% discount <br>
60 days - 10% discount <br>
90 days - 18% discount <br>
150 days - 25% discount <br>
240 days - 30% discount </p>

<p><i>240 days is actually 8 months!</i> That means you don't have to worry about renewing that 
referral for 9 months, and you are receiving the <u>maximum discount</u> possible. </p>

<p>When you have enough money to renew for <b>90 days</b>, turn AutoPay off, and turn 
on AutoRenew. Depending on how many referrals you have, and how much $$$ you have in 
your balance, select the discount days that best fits you. </p>

<p>AutoPay is more useful for standard members than upgraded members. Why? <i>Because at some point, 
renewing is more beneficial than using auto pay</i>. AutoPay will give you a 10% discount, 
but if you renew for 90 days, the same 10% discount you will get for 60 days of renewing. When
you renew for 90 days, your discount is 18%, which is higher than that of AutoPay, that is
why at this point you should turn AutoPay off. </p>
