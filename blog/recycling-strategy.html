<p>As you know, rented referrals (RR) is the name of the game at Neobux. Simply put, the more active RR's you have, the more money you will make. A lot of users think they can make profit from Neobux without recycling. That kind of thinking leads to improper account management. Even the admin of Neobux says that recycling aggressively is a surefire way to success. The fact is that people stop clicking, and they need to be replaced. </p>

<p>So in this post, we are going to cover some simple recyling strategies. </p>
 

<p>Neobux has a cool feature called <i>auto recycle</i> where a referral is recycled for free if they do not click in 14 days. You should take full advantage of that feature, however, 14 days is too long of a period to wait. There are certain times when, if you feel for certain that a referral isnâ€™t going to be profitable you should manually recycle that referral. </p>


<p>The exceptions to this rule are <b>standard members</b>. With the rate of 0.001 per click and the fact that recycling costs $0.07, you are prone to lose money if you recycle. As a standard member <b>do not recycle</b>, instead use auto recycle to your advantage. </p>


<p>For upgraded members, you may want to look at Auto-Renew</p>


 
<h2>What is Auto-Renew and why should you use it?</h2>
Firstly, auto pay only works if the referral: <br>
* Has 20 days remaining <br>
* Is actively clicking</p>

<p>Each time a referral clicks, 1 day will be added to their expiration date. So, 
you are automatically paying for them from your rental balance. It is useful if you 
have a lot of referrals and don't want to renew them. Your referrals will not expire as long as they are clicking, and you will save <b>10%</b> in renewal fees over time.</p>


<p>AutoRenew is a relatively new feature in Neobux - the way it work is simple - you can
choose when you would like to renew a RR, and for how long. For example, you can
renew a RR for 30 days just 3 days before the RR's expiration date.</p>

<p>The discounts are as follows: <br>
15 days - no discount <br>
30 days - 5% discount <br>
60 days - 10% discount <br>
90 days - 18% discount <br>
150 days - 25% discount <br>
240 days - 30% discount </p>

<p><i>240 days is actually 8 months!</i> That means you don't have to worry about renewing that referral for 9 months, and you are receiving the <u>maximum discount</u> possible. </p>

<p>When you have enough money to renew for <b>90 days</b>, turn AutoPay off, and turn 
on AutoRenew. Depending on how many referrals you have, and how much $$$ you have in 
your balance, select the discount days that best fits you. </p>


<h2>AutoPay vs Auto-Renew</h2>

<p>AutoPay is more useful for standard members than upgraded members. Why? <i>Because at some point, renewing is more beneficial than using auto pay</i>. AutoPay will give you a 10% discount, but if you renew for 90 days, the same 10% discount you will get for 60 days of renewing. When you renew for 90 days, your discount is 18%, which is higher than that of AutoPay, that is why at this point you should turn AutoPay off. </p>

<p>So in summary, as a standard member, you should use auto recycle - there is no work needed on your part as it happens automatically. Turn on AutoPay to get the maximum discount. After upgrading to Golden, turn off AutoPay and turn on Auto-Renew. </p>


<p>To monitor your referral's activities, Neobux has a number system. This system lets you 
know whether you are <i>profiting</i> (2.0+), <i>breaking even</i> (2.0), or <i>losing money</i> (2.0-). Constantly recycle inactive RRs. Recycling costs 0.07 per referral and it is better to recycle in the long run. </p> 


<p>With the RR's on auto-renew, you are paying for the upkeep of these referrals. You want to constantly recycle until you have a high average (2.0 or higher). For standard members, <i>anything less than 2.0 means you are losing money</i>. Keep recycling until you have a team of active users. I recommend recycling anyone that has not clicked in <b>4 days</b>. </p>

<p>*Note: This is true for upgraded members. Neobux reduced the earning rate for
standard members to $0.001 per click, drastically reducing their earnings. Because of these
lower earnings, standard members should recycle conservatively and use auto-recycle more often. </p>

<h2>How Aggressively Should You Recycle?</h2>











<p>These are just general guidelines to follow. There is no one size fits all answer for recycling, it is something you need to do constantly and see if it gets you better results. You need to recognize referral's clicking patterns so you can identify which ones are good and which ones are bad.
