<p>A lot of PTC users have experienced this problem when they first started: which sites to join? 
	It may seem trival for experienced users, since there are many resources available that 
	rank PTC sites. But some people are still lost and confused as to which sites they should join.</p>

	we're only going to list sites that we like, and have been paid by them.
