<p>When you start taking surveys, you notice certain patterns develop. There are some sites that lie to you and waste your time, or worse, waste your money. Today I wanted to go over 5 do's and dont's of taking surveys. Use these best practices and ensure that your journey will be smooth. Let's get right into it. </p>

<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Do look for programs that offer affiliate commissions.</b> </p>
<p>It's better to spend your time building a downline than have to do manual work all the time. Multiple ways of earning are always welcome. If the commissions are lifetime commissions, even better. The best survey downline programs are <a href="<?=$outsideLinkB?>" target="_BLANK">SurveySavvy</a>. and <a href="<?=$outsideLinkA?>" target="_BLANK">PrizeRebel</a>. </p>


<p><a href="<?=$outsideLinkA?>" target="_BLANK">PrizeRebel</a> has a downline program that will pay you 20% of your downline's surveys earnings...for life. It is 30% for platinum members. I prefer downline programs to pay lifetime earnings, because it just makes more sense...each downline is more valuable to you and makes you more motivated to <a href="<?=$outsideLinkA?>" target="_BLANK">build your downline</a>. </p>


<p><a href="<?=$outsideLinkB?>" target="_BLANK">SurveySavvy</a> has a 2 level downline program. The first level pays you $2 for each survey your downline completes. The second level pays $1 for each survey completed. If you have a <a href="<?=$outsideLinkB?>" target="_BLANK">huge downline</a>, you can see how your earnings can add up. You can use the Neobux Ultimate Strategy to build your downline. </p>


<p><?=$X_img?><b> Do research the program before you join.</b></p> 
<p>There are variety of factors to be taken into account: which countries do they accept, and how will they pay you? Do they offer alternative ways to earn money besides surveys? </p>

<p>With Best Paying Sites, you will have access to our list of 100+ legit and paying survey partners. All the work has been done for you so you don't have to worry about getting scammed. Just sign up and get paid! </p>
 
<p><?=$X_img?> Do seek out programs that offer more than surveys. Making up to $150 for special research projects or product testing is possible. You'll have to earn it though, focus groups of this nature will usually take a few days of participation. </p>

<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Do complete your profile.</b>

<p> Some offers will not be shown to you unless if you complete your profile. Also, it's okay to change your information a bit if you don't qualify. You'll never know what happens unless you keep trying. </p>
 

<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Do take advantage of your smartphone.</b></p>
<p>Nowadays, there are more and more apps that let you take surveys on the go. There's also programs that pays you for letting their app run in the background. </p>

<p>Did you know Best Paying Surveys has a database of paying apps that you can use on the go? If you're not in front of your computer you can still earn some cash with your mobile phone. </p>

<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Don't get stuck on any one survey program </b></p>
<p>If you find yourself often being disqualified, or receiving surveys that are low paying, you're probably not in the demographic for that particular survey. Instead of being frustrated, just move on. There's plenty of sites out there that are happy to pay for your input, finding the right one is the key. </p>



<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Don't fall for programs that promise to pay big</b></p>
<p>Some programs say they pay $75 or more for a 5 minute survey, but there's no way it can be true. If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. You'll just end up wasting your time. Be realistic and only take surveys that are legit. 
</p>

<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Don't pay for anything in hopes of larger reward</b></p>
<p>There are many of what's called the "free trial" scam. These trials are not free at all, they promise to pay you $50 to try a service like Netflix. Offers like this are sometimes full of stipulations such as you have to stay subscribed for one years. Many people end up losing money rather than making money on these free trial offers. </p>


<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Don't join programs that ask for too little information</b></p>
<p>While it's easy to sign up for a program that may only ask for your name and email address, you'll find that many of these operations are a waste of time. Generally, the less detailed info a program asks for, the less you'll earn per survey since the market research is tailored to a more generic audience. Many GPT sites fall into this category.</p>

<p><?=$X_img?> <b>Don't get discouraged!</b></p>
<p>There's no one best way to earn by taking paid surveys, but you can find the best way that works for you. Try a mix of survey programs, GPT sites, and mobile programs. Discover what works for you and what doesn't. No one is going to get rich taking surveys, but you can certainly put a few extra bucks in your pocket if you stick with it for the long term.
</p>

<p>P.S. If you want to make $4,000+ a month with online surveys, then you need to visit Best Paying Surveys - it's only for serious money makers: <br />
