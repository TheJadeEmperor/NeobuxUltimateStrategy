<p>Many of our subscribers have contacted us after losing their Neobux passwords.
For some reason, people think that we are Neobux or that we somehow have control over
their accounts. Unfortunately, that is simply not true (although we're honored you 
think that). It's just surprising how frequently we get emails like this:</p>

<p>"Help, I forgot my password. Can you retrieve it for me?"</p>

<p>That is why we're writing this post - to show you how to recover your Neobux 
account password. On the login screen, you will see a big, shiny blue button
that says "Recover Password" - please see screenshot below. </p>

<p><img src="<?=$imgLink?>password1.jpg" border=1 alt="Neobux Account - Forgot Password"></p>

Click on that button to be taken to the next screen. Here, you need to input your
username and your year of birth, the one you provided upon registration. 

<p><img src="<?=$imgLink?>password2.jpg" border=1 alt="Neobux Account - Forgot Password"></p>

Then, just enter the captcha code and click on "send" - now you will wait
for an email from Neobux support. They will generate a new password for you
and send you an email that looks like this:

<p><img src="<?=$imgLink?>password3.jpg" alt="Neobux Account - Forgot Password" width="90%"></p>

<p>And that is all you have to do to recover your password. If you forgot your year
of birth however, then you cannot use this process. You will have to contact Neobux
directly and ask them to recover your accuont for you. Please contact them (not us)
at this address: <b><a href="mailto:support@neobux.com">support@neobux.com</a></b></p>

<p>It is your responsibility to remember your usernames and passwords. If you lose a 
password then you probably have trouble being organized. You need to keep track of 
all your ptc accounts to make your life easier. Put all your accounts into one 
document and update it often. When you join a new site, make sure you update your
passwords file.</p>

<p>Tracking and management becomes less fun when you have tons and tons of sites to manage.
That's why it's a good idea to be active in only 5 to 10 sites at a time. 10 usernames
and passwords is manageable for most people and it decreases the chances of you losing
a password. </p>

<h3>Help, My Neobux Account Got Banned! </h3>

<p>This is another common question we get asked - well, it's more like a plea
	for help than a question. Unfortunately, we do not control who gets banned or not,
	it is entirely up to Neobux. We feel your pain and sympathize with you, but at this
	point, you need to be prepared for the worst case scenario. </p>
	
<p>I hate to say it, but you need to be mentally prepared that you will never see
	your account again. Neobux's banning policies are very strict. But, if you are
	innocent, then send an email to Neobux support explaining what happened: 
	<b><a href="mailto:support@neobux.com">support@neobux.com</a></b></p>
	
<p>I don't know the size of their staff or how reasonable they are when it comes
	to these matters, but it's worth a try. They may restore your account, they
	may not. </p>
	
<p>Take a deep breath and don't panic. It's probably not the end of the world as you think. 
	But I understand that being banned can be very painful and you may not know how to deal
	with it. Look at it this way: it could be worse. You could lose your health, your
	job, or your loved ones. Neobux is the best PTC, but not the only PTC. Take this 
	opportunity to explore other sites - the internet is brimming with them. </p>
	
<p>Make some money with other sites, and soon you'll start to feel better already. Although
	none of those sites can replace Neobux, they will provide you with what you need - 
	money - that's ultimate goal, isn't it? Even if you don't have Neobux, you will be able
	to make money from PTC's, so don't worry, sit back and relax, and start clicking :) </p>
