<p>There is an old saying that goes: "You have to be prepared for success." That is true in any business, especially the PTC business. This is not just a hobby, but a business that will make you hundreds and even thousands of dollars a month. That's why it's important to be prepared. If you have already read this guide and followed the steps, then congratulations. You are on your to making fast money online with ptc sites. But do you referrals have the same information? Share this page on social media with your friends and spread the word! </p>

<h1>Step 1 - How Many Sites to Join</h1>


<p> Is there such a thing as too many PTCs? Have a headache managing all these accounts? 
Chances are, if you have more than 10 PTC or GPT sites, you are doing too much. <b>A good balance 
is 5 to 10 sites.</b> We are all tempted, at one point or another, to join as many sites as possible, hoping to make a lot of money. But realistically, it is too much for one person to handle. </p>

<p>Several people have told me that at any given point, they have 20 to 30 PTC's that they
surf daily. That is insane if you think about it! You're supposed to diversify, but this is
not the way. Think about it, you have to have 20 different accounts, which means 20 
usernames and passwords to memorize and keep track of. Also, you have to keep track of
20 different sets of referrals. Every PTC is different has their own rules and special
features, which you also have to memorize. </p>

<p>And on top of that, you have click for hours every day just to earn a little bit of
money. Having 5 to 10 sites that you use daily is the optimum number, any more than that is overload. You may have to "weed out" the lower quality websites and keep only the best ones. 
It is a tough decision, but we all have to do it. How many PTC's you use is completely
up to you. If you can handle more than 10 and are making a lot of money from each one
then congratulations, because you are succeeding. But that is usually the exception
not the rule. </p>

<h1>Step 2 - Have the right browser and tools </h1>

<p>The optimal browser we recommend for PTC sites is Opera. It has many features including tabbed browsing, an ad blocker plugin and a built-in pop up blocker that will make your life a lot easier. You should also bookmark all your PTC and traffic exhange sites for easier access.</p>

<p>We have written an entire article about this topic. Click below to find out the best browser to use for PTC Sites:

<h1>Step 3 - Payment Processors</h1>

<p>As you know by now, no PTC sites can use Paypal anymore. Neobux and Clixsense has other payment processors available. The ideal form of payment would be Bitcoins, but unfortunately these sites don't use Bitcoin yet. </p>

<p>Most major sites will take Payoneer, Neteller or Skrill. If you haven't signed up yet, now is a good time to do so. </p>

<p>They will require you to verify by connecting your bank account or credit card. Make sure that you're in good standing with your processors - if you have pending issues with them, make sure to get the issues fixed right away. You don't want to deal with extra problems while you're doing your PTC business.</p>

<p>You may also want to open a Bitcoin account in case people start catching on and finally decide to use Bitcoins. </p>


<h1>Step 4 - Account Management</h1>

<p>Being organized will speed things along in your journey. Each time you open a new account, jot the down the username and password, and save it into a text file. Grab your referral links and place them into another file. Also, grab your banner URL's and paste them into the same file, or a different file if you wish. These files will be your reference in case you need them.</p>

<p>We recommend that you use the same username in every website to keep things simple. All your referral links will point to the same username. But obviously, do <b>not</b> use the same password everywhere.</p>


<p><b>Use your browser to save passwords to save time</b></p>

<p>In the beginning, we tend to memorize our usernames & passwords. However, as you join more websites, there are more accounts to manage, and remembering passwords can be a bit of a hassle.
</p>

<p>Password savers come in handy because they save you the trouble of having to remember them, which saves you time. Most modern browsers will have a feature where you can save passwords. </p>

<p>Another option is to use a password manager like LastPass. Not only does it store your passwords securely, but it can also generate passwords for you. If you want your internet excperience to be seemless, this is the way to go.</p>


<h1>Step 5 - Daily Clicking </h1>

<p>To make consistent income you have to be consistent. Set aside a time where you can do clicking everyday - a time slot of 20 to 30 minutes (depending on how many sites you have). Some people do it before breakfast, during their lunch break, or just before they sleep. Whichever it is, make sure that time is dedicated to PTC's and remember to do it daily.</p>

<p>This is where tabbed browsing and password amnagers come in handy. They will ddo most of the boring work for you. </p>

<p>You will also need perform various duties such as recycling, renewing, and renting referrals. Each PTC is different so you will determine how much time you need for each one. </p>

<p>At the beginning it will feel like a job, but you will get used to it after 2 to 3 weeks of doing it over and over. Repetition is the mother of all learning. Soon you'll be doing these things will ease, and you may actually enjoy it, especially if you see results. </p>


<h1>Step 5 - What Sites to Join?</h1>

<p>Another big question we are confronted with is what sites to join?  I'm not going to tell you in this post, as there are too many PTC's out there. There are so many PTC's out there, it is hard to tell which ones are legit and which ones are scams. If you get scammed, it is the admin's fault, but it is also your fault for not doing your due diligence. Remember that research is your responsibility. </p>
 
<h2>How to Avoid Scams</h2>

<p>The scam rate for bux sites is high – it feels as if everyday, a bux site becomes a scam, 
	and in the same day, another bux site is born. In this field, you need to take certain measures 
	to protect yourself from being scammed. The good news is that when a site is becoming a scam, 
	there are certain tell-tale signs that indicate as such. Usually these signs are pretty obvious, so we will list them out for you.</p>

<p><b>Signs of abandonment.</b> If the admin does not answer questions on the forum, 
or if there are broken links or errors on the site, and they are not being fixed, 
these are signs of abandonment. Maybe the admin has given up on the site, so watch 
out for these signs. </p>

<p><b>Many complaints.</b> If a site has many complaints against it, pay close attention, 
	because the users are not happy. Use google to find out more information – 
	we suggest typing the site’s name followed by the word scam. For example, try “onbux scam” – 
	you'll never know if the results are what you expected. </p>

<p><b> Being picky with payments.</b> If a site pays certain members, but does not pay others, 
	that is a big red flag. It probably means they are running out of money, so they can only pay 
	a small amount of members. Many bux sites rely on ads and upgrades for funds, 
	and if the funds run out, then they will not be able to pay its members. If you have a pending 
	cash out and have not received your payment yet, then send a support ticket and see what happens. Hopefully they are just having delays – but always expect the worst case scenario. </p>

<p><b>Revenue is unsustainable.</b> If the PTC site doesn't generate revenue, then the admin will shut it down. Unfortunately, that's the reality of this business. If you feel that a business model is too good to be true, it usually is. If a PTC seems unprofitable for the admin, it's a red flag that the site will soon be shut down. We recommend that you join early - as close to launch date as possible. This is usually when the PTC is the most profitable and is paying with no problems. If you join later - like 1 to 2 years after launch, it increases the chances of you getting scammed. </p>

	
<p>If you follow these guidelines and do your due diligence, then you can avoid scams 
	and save yourself a lot of headaches. These tips are general guidelines on how to manage
	PTC's. To earn some real money online, get the Neobux Ultimate Strategy today. </p>
