<h3>How Much is Too Much?</h3>

<p>Today I wanted to go over some basic pointers to making money with PTC sites. 
Is there such a thing as too many PTCs? Have a headache managing all these accounts? 
Chances are, if you have more than 10 PTC / GPT sites, you are doing too much. <b>A good balance 
is 5 to 10 sites.</b> We are all tempted, at one point or another, to join as many sites as possible, 
hoping to make a lot of money. But realistically, it is too much for one person to handle. </p>

<p>Several people have told me that at any given point, they have 20 to 30 PTC's that they
surf daily. That is insane if you think about it! You're supposed to diversify, but this is
not the way. Think about it, you have to have 20 different accounts, which means 20 
usernames and passwords to memorize and keep track of. Also, you have to keep track of
20 different sets of referrals. Every PTC is different has their own rules and special
features, which you also have to memorize. </p>

<p>And on top of that, you have click for hours every day just to earn a little bit of
money. Having 5 to 10 sites that you use daily is the optimum number, any more than that is overload. 
You may have to "weed out" the lower quality websites and keep only the best ones. 
It is a tough decision, but we all have to do it. How many PTC's you use is completely
up to you. If you can handle more than 10 and are making a lot of money from each one
then congratulations, because you are succeeding. But that is usually the exception
not the rule. </p>

There is an old saying that goes: "You have to be prepared for success." That is true in any business, especially the PTC business. This is not just a hobby, but a business that will make you hundreds, and even thousands of dollars a month. That's why it's important to be prepared. If you are already fully prepared, then congratulations, but do your referrals have the same info?

Have the right browser

Does this happen to you - you click on an ad, you view the website and wait for the counter like you're supposed to, and when you close the window, and suddenly, a pop up appears. Usually it says something like "Wait Don't Miss Our Offer!" or "Sign Up for Our Offer!"

Whatever the reason is, pop ups are annoying. We recommend using Opera
Its a popular browser known for its speed and efficiency. Opera has a feature where you can disable pop up messages permanently, so that your surfing experience won't be hindered by unwanted messages. All you have to do is download it from Opera's website

Another browser that we recommend is Firefox, a trusted and stable browser. You can install add-ons that prevent pop ups from hindering you. But no matter what browser you are using, don't use Internet Explorer - it has too many problems and it will hinder your browsing experience. Remember, your time is valuable - so you shouldn't have to deal with pop ups.

Don't join too many sites

Is there such a thing as too many PTCs? Have a headache managing all these accounts? Chances are, if you have more than 10 PTC / GPT sites, you are doing too much. A good balance is 5 to 10 sites. We are all tempted, at one point or another, to join as many sites as possible, hoping to make a lot of money. But realistically, it is too much for one person to handle.

Having 5 to 10 sites that you use daily is the optimum number, any more is overload. You may have to "weed out" the lower quality websites and keep only the best ones. It is a tough decision, but we all have to do it.

Research is your responsibility

There are so many PTC's out there, it is hard to tell which ones are legit and which ones are scams. If you get scammed, it is the admin's fault, but it is also your fault for not doing your due diligence. Use the following website as starting points.


PTC Central has been around for many years, and is known for their honesty and unbiased opinions. If you want to find out which sites are scams and which are legit, then visit this site.

Payment processors

Most sites will accept Paypal and Alertpay, so make sure you have those to processors ready. They will require you to verify by connecting your bank account or credit card. Make sure that you're in good standing with your processors - if you have pending issues with paypal or alertpay then make sure to get the issues fixed right away. You don't want to deal with extra problems while you're doing your PTC business.

Use your browser to save passwords

In the beginning, we tend to memorize our usernames & passwords. However, as you join more websites, there are more accounts to manage, and remembering passwords can be a bit of a hassle.

Password savers come in handy because they save you the trouble of having to remember them, which saves you time. Most browser will have a feature where you can save passwords. Our recommended browsers are (in order) Opera and Firefox.

Save your accounts in a text file

Being organized will speed things along in your journey. Each time you open a new account, jot the down the username and password, and save it into a text file. Grab your referral links and place them into another file. Also, grab your banner URL's and paste them into the same file, or a different file if you wish. These files will be your reference in case you need them.

Daily clicking

To make consistent income you have to be consistent. Set aside a time where you can do clicking everyday - a time slot of 20 to 30 minutes (depending on how many sites you have). Some people do it before breakfast, during their lunch break, or just before they sleep. Whichever it is, make sure that time is dedicated to PTC's and remember to do it daily.

Account management

In addition to clicking, you need to manage your account, performing various duties such as recycling, renewing, and renting referrals. Each PTC is different so you will determine how much time you need for each one.

At the beginning it will feel like a job, but you will get used to it after 2 to 3 weeks of doing it over and over. Repetition is the mother of all learning. Soon you'll be doing these things will ease, and you may actually enjoy it, especially if you see results.



<h3>What Sites to Join?</h3>

<p>Another big question we are confronted with is what sites to join? 
I'm not going to tell you in this post, as there are too many PTC's out there. 
But I know of a website that review PTC's and I recommend using them as research starting points.</p>

<p>PTC Investigation has been around for many years, and is known for their brutal honesty and 
unbiased opinions. If you want to find out which sites are scams and which are legit, 
then visit this site. </p>

<h3>How to Avoid Scams</h3>

<p>The scam rate for bux sites is high – it feels as if everyday, a bux site becomes a scam, 
	and in the same day, another bux site is born. In this field, you need to take certain measures 
	to protect yourself from being scammed. The good news is that when a site is becoming a scam, 
	there are certain tell-tale signs that indicate as such. Usually these signs are pretty obvious, 
	so we will list them out for you.</p>

<p><i>Signs of abandonment.</i> If the admin does not answer questions on the forum, 
or if there are broken links or errors on the site, and they are not being fixed, 
these are signs of abandonment. Maybe the admin has given up on the site, so watch 
out for these signs. </p>

<p><i>Many complaints.</i> If a site has many complaints against it, pay close attention, 
	because the users are not happy. Use google to find out more information – 
	we suggest typing the site’s name followed by the word scam. For example, try “onbux scam” – 
	you'll never know if the results are what you expected. </p>

<p><i> Being picky with payments.</i> If a site pays certain members, but does not pay others, 
	that is a big red flag. It probably means they are running out of money, so they can only pay 
	a small amount of members. Many bux sites rely on ads and upgrades for funds, 
	and if the funds run out, then they will not be able to pay its members. If you have a pending 
	cash out and have not received your payment yet, then send a support ticket and see what happens. 
	Hopefully they are just having delays – but always expect the worst case scenario. </p>

<p><i>Problems with Paypal & Alertpay.</i> The whole point of joining a new site is to cash out, right? 
	Then what if you can’t, because the site is having problems with Papyal or Alertpay? 
	If that happens, that is a red flag, an indication that the site is going downhill. </p>
	
<p>If you follow these guidelines and do your due diligence, then you can avoid scams 
	and save yourself a lot of headaches. These tips are general guidelines on how to manage
	PTC's. To earn some real money online, get the Neobux Ultimate Strategy today. </p>
