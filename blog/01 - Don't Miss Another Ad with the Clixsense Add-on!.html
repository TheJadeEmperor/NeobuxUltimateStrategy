<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>, </p>

<p>Today I want to tell you about a Clixsense feature that's been around for a while, yet has been under-rated. The ClixAddon is a useful tool that can help you make more money by telling when ads are available for clicking. </p>
	
<p>If you have not tried the toolbar, called ClixAddon, you should consider doing it. Make more money by being informed when ads are available for clicking. All you have to do is keep your browser open and keep your eye on the toolbar. </p>
	
<p>It takes almost no space at all and is easy to install. You'll also have your updated balance at the distance of a single click without disturbing you from what you're doing in your computer.</p>

<p>Get the add-on here: <br />
<a href="<?=$outsideLink?>" target="_blank"><?=$outsideLink?></a> </p>

<p>It is available for all major browsers, and the toolbar will be automatically updated (depending on your browser's settings) so that you'll always have the latest version.</p>

<p>Try it out. If you don't like it, you can always uninstall at the click of a button. </p>


<p>Hopefully this tip helped you out. If you have not joined Clixsense yet, then sign up here: <a href="<?=$refLink?>" target="_blank">Sign up to Clixsense</a></p>

<p>Happy earnings!</p>
