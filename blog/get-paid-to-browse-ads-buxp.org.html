<p>At BuxP you get paid to click on ads, watch videos, and complete surveys or complete offers.This site was established back in 2008, the same year that Neobux was launched. So it has been around for 4 years, and paying on time with little to no problems. </p><h3>What are some of the benefits of using BuxP?</h3><p>Cashouts are fixed at $8.00 and this amount will never change. They support several payment	processors and they are paying on time. BuxP also has a forum - forums are good for communication	between members and staff and for members to express any concerns or problems they may have.</p> <p>Here are the earnings rate: <br />	10 Second Ads: $0.001 <br />30 Second Ads: $0.005 <br />45 Second Ads: $0.006 <br />Video Ads: $0.001 <br />Video Offer Ads: $0.003</p><p>You also get a commission if one of your referrals buys an advertising package from their site. 	The commission varies depending on the type of ad they bought, and your level of membership. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://buxp.org/?r=theemperor" target=_blank>	<img src="images/banners/buxP.gif" alt="BuxP" title="BuxP" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What are some of the downsides of BuxP?</h3><p>The cashout rate is $8.00 for standard members, which is pretty high compared to other PTC's. Most	other PTC's have a a threshold of $1 or $2. It might be a little difficult to reach $8.00 without	any direct referrals. </p><p>Warning: beware of the anti-cheat advertisement! The anti-cheat link is at the very bottom of the page and it is says in bold red letters DO NOT VISIT. See image below:</p><img src="images/guide/buxpAntiCheat.jpg" alt="BuxP" title="BuxP" /><p>This is not a prank - if you click on this link your balance will be wiped out and turn to ZERO. This is	an issue for those who don't pay attention and click the link anyway. </p><p>This anti cheat link is for them to catch cheaters who use automated programs to click on ads.	Unfortunately, some people still click on this ad and end up losing all their money. And they	start saying that BuxP is a scam. </p><p>If this happens to you, you need to contact their customer support right away. We can't say for	sure they will restore your balance, but it won't hurt to try. </p><h3>The BuxP Toolbar</h3><p>Just like Neobux, they have their own toolbar that you can install instantly into your browser.	This toolbar will show you your account balance and ads available for viewing at the moment. </p>	<p>If you browse the web all the day, this toolbar is beneficial to you, as you can see more ads	and make more money. </p><img src="images/guide/buxpToolbar.jpg" alt="BuxP" title="BuxP" /><p>If you are an advertiser, there are several advertising options available for you. You can buy PTC Ads, video ads, facebook likes, and even twitter followers. And also, each time one of your referrals buys	an ad, you will get a small commission out of it. </p>	<p>In addition to their forum, BuxP also has its own blog, accessible from the main website. If you	are curious about their progress or want to stay up to date, then check out their blog. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Should You Use BuxP?</h3><p>BuxP has been established for over 4 years now. Some members may have had issues with this site,	the number of complaints is insignificant compared to their quality of service and reputation.	We feel that this site is safe to use. </p><p>Although you won't get rich with BuxP, you can make a nice chunk of change every month with this	site. It will be hard to cashout without any referrals, so use the strategies in the Neobux Ultimate 	Strategy to get tons of referrals everyday. </p>	<p><a href="https://buxp.org/?r=theemperor" target=_blank>	<img src="images/banners/buxP.gif" alt="BuxP" title="BuxP" /></a></p>				<p>Benjamin Louie <br />    Neobux Ultimate Strategy<br /><a href="https://neobuxultimatestrategy.com">https://neobuxultimatestrategy.com</a></p>
