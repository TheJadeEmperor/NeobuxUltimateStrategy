<h1>Is Neobux a Scam Or Not? </h1>


<p>Is Neobux a scam or a legit site? To put it simply, no, Neobux is not a scam.  </p>

<p>That being said, there are a large number of people who claim that Neobux is a scam due to bad experiences with the site. They have made very little money or they have been banned. However, not making enough money does not qualify a site as a "scam." First, I want to give you some facts so you can make your own decision whether or not Neobux is a scam. </p>

<p>Here are some facts about Neobux: 

<ul>
	<li>To date, Neobux has 20,000,000+ members registered on the site. According to the Neobux
		admin, roughly 80,000 to 100,000 people log in to their site everyday.</li>

	<li>Neobux has been online since 2008 and has paid $90 million to their members</li>

	<li>It is one of the few PTC's that pay instantly - and by that I mean immediately,
		once you cashout you receive the money in your Payment processor in seconds. </li>

	<li>There are payment proofs all over the internet, proving Neobux's legitimacy</li>

</ul>
</p>


<p>As you can see, Neobux has a solid business with a good reputation amongst its members. With a $2.00 cashout limit and instant cashouts, it is definately legit PTC site, in fact, it is the leader of PTC Sites. </p>

<p>In my own experience, I have no problems with Neobux as of yet. They pay instantly and if there is a problem, they always solve it in a timely manner. </p>

<h2>The Dark Side of Neobux</h2>

<p>Despite their reputation, there is a dark side to Neobux that many don't know about. There is a rumor that Neobux uses bots as rented referrals. Considering that rented referrals are a major source of income, this is a legit concern. </p>


<p>Here are some of the common complaints against Neobux:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Neobux is using bots as rented referrals</li>
	<li>They ban innocent people with no explanation</li>
	<li>Standard members make only 0.001 per click which means you make less money per hour than a Mexican</li>
	<li>They can no longer use Paypal for payments</li>
</ul>



<h2>Are Neobux referrals bots? </h2>

<p>When we rent referrals the problem is we expect too much of them. We expect them to be clicking machines, but in reality, they are lazy people just like us. If a referral has a strange behavior pattern, people think that it's a bot and start accusing Neobux for renting out bots. We are human too, and we are not perfect. We sometimes don't feel like logging into our account and clicking on ads. Sometimes we forget. Sometimes are we busy with life. Just because a referral has an erratic clicking pattern doesn't make it a bot. </p>

<p><i>"But my referral used to click a lot. Now it stopped clicking completely. Isn't that a bot?"</i></p>

<p>Not necesarily. Remember that we are human, and humans have a chaotic and unpredicable nature. Most people who join PTC's fail - they don't see the money and quit Neobux after a few weeks. So it is completely reasonable to expect referrals to stop clicking after some time. That is the way things are and there is nothing you can do to control that. Just keep recycling until you get some good referrals. </p>

<p>Also consider the fact that 99% of your rented referrals are standard members. They earn only 0.001 per click, which is very low. That's why many will quit before they see success. </p>


<p>If you want to learn how to recycle like a master, we have written a post on how to do that. <a href="./?p=neobux-recycling-tips" target="_BLANK"><?=$websiteURL?>?p=neobux-recycling-tips</a></p>

<p>Renting for Golden members is a pain in the ass. If you are golden, then you know what I mean.  You can only rent referrals once a week and <b>only</b> during a certain time of day. You set the time of day in your account settings - you can choose 2 specific times - for example, 2:00 and 3:00 pm. All other times you cannot rent due the limited number of referrals available. Think about it, if Neobux is using bots, wouldn't they just let you rent any time you want, instead of placing all these restrictions? </p>

<p>At the end of the day, the rumor of them using bots is just a rumor. Humans are just too lazy to click daily, and because they become inactive, many people assume they are bots. To this day, there is no solid evidence of them using bots. So we can safely say that this rumor is false. </p>


<h2>How do you get banned from Neobux?</h2>

<p>Many of our subscribers have contacted us after being unjustly banned by Neobux. I don't have enough information to decide if Neobux is right or wrong for doing so. But I can give you some basic
rules on what to do. Neobux is extra strict with rules, so make sure you follow them. </p>

<p>Do not make more than 1 account per computer. Doing so will get you banned right away, so don't
even think about it, it's not worth it. Also, do not go to a friend's computer to log in to your
account. Doing so might get both you and your friend banned. If you are not able to click ads from your own computer I suggest you skip clicking ads for that day. Missing out on a few cents is better than getting banned.</p>
	
	
<p>If you do not login for over 90 days, your account is considered inactive, and will be deleted from their system. Unfortunately, a few people have made this mistake, and lost their account and have to start over. But if you login once every 90 days, which isn't a lot, you're fine. </p>

<p>If you feel you have been wrongfully banned and you're lost on what to do, we have written a post about this topic.

<h2>Why do standard members earn so low?</h2>

<p>Sometime in early 2011, Neobux gave us a slap on the face, reducing the earnings rate to 0.001 per click. Many people speculate this is because Neobux is running out of money, so they need to protect themselves by giving people less money. Whether that is true or not is yet to be determined. </p>

<p>But one thing is for sure. This was a bad move by Neobux, because it makes people angry and lose their trust in the site. Basically what they're saying is "you must upgrade and if you don't you will make almost nothing" - as a result a lot of people left the site. You may think this doesn't affect goldens and ultimates, but you are wrong. A lot of standards stop clicking, which is troubling because many of our rented referrals are standard members. If they stop clicking it means other people are earning less. So everyone is affected. </p>

<p>Suprisingly, the site has not gone downhill, but it is getting better and better. They have redeemed themselves by adding the new NeoPoints feature, as well as many other bonuses. Despite all these new improvements, the earnings rate has not improved. Although Neobux is getting better in terms of site usability, that drop in earnings left a sour taste in our mouths, a bitter feeling that will stay for a long, long time. </p>

<p>There are several ways to earn money with Neobux besides referral clicks. You can use their Coin Offers by doing tasks and surveys. They also let you earn by playing games - this is one of their newest features. You will be taken to an outside site and you must play a game for 2 minutes minimum to get the credits. Whenever you referrals completes a task or survey, you will get a small commission from them. </p>

<p>Even though earnings are very little, Neobux gives you several ways to earn commissions on the site, which will keep you from being bored. </p>


<h2>My experiences with Neobux </h2>

<p>When I first joined Neobux back in 2010, I saw it as a way to earn money without having to spend any money. I was clicking diligently everyday so eventually I could rent referrals and earn more money on auto-pilot. I was very happy with their system - the look was professional, the site was fast, and their forums were very lively. </p>

<p>Although I always tell people not to spend money on these kinds of sites, I spent the money to get a golden account. It cost me $90, but every penny spent was worth it. With my new membership, I was able to double my earnings (0.005 per click to 0.01 per click) and I was cashing out left and right. </p>

<p> Here is a screenshot of a payment I received from Neobux </p>

<h2>Why can't Neobux use Paypal anymore?</h2>

<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017, Paypal decided to slap Neobux in the face by terminating their account...permanently. Many other major PTC's faced the same fate, some of them including Clixsense. This was a decision made by Paypal alone, so it was not up to Neobux. The admin of Neobux promised that members would not lose a single penny, and he made good on his promises, like he always has. </p>

<p>More info can be found at their forum<a href="https://www.neobux.com/forum/?/3/630469/Regarding-PayPal/" target="_BLANK">https://www.neobux.com/forum/?/3/630469/Regarding-PayPal/</a></p>
	

<h2>How good is Neobux support?</h2>

<p>One time I faced a very strange problem, a problem I am sure that not too many people have. One of my direct referrals was my friend, and I knew his username and can check his activity at any time. But one day I checked my account and he was no longer in my list. I was wondering why, there were several possibilities. Neobux automatically deletes referrals that are not active for 60 days. 
So I assumed that my friend was inactive for that time, however that is not the case. I spoke to him
and it turns out he is actively clicking everyday. He even showed me his account to confirm it. </p>

<p>So the big question is - why did my referral disappear? I know for sure I did not "accidentally" delete him. And he has been active every day. So where did he go? I was lost, so I decided to contact Neobux support, hoping they can shed some light on this problem. I contacted them twice and heard nothing back. </p>

	

<h2>Is Neobux a legit site to earn money?</h2>

<p>So if you are stuck on something, their staff will <b>not</b> help you. If you need help, then good luck, because they don't care about you. They probably receive thousands of questions daily. So I understand they are a little busy. But I was stuck with a legit problem, and I was not able to get my problem solved, and lost a lot of potential revenue because of this. </p>

<p>In conclusion, I feel that Neobux is a <i>safe place</i> to earn a solid income online. They are not a scam, but rather, a legit and growing business. However, if you break their rules, they will ban you without a second thought. They can pretty much do whatever they want, so don't invest money in it if you do not feel comfortable giving someone else all the power. Neobux is jam packed with innovations and features - but if you need help, then good luck, you are not getting any. If you are fine with that then go ahead and join Neobux - it's worth a shot. </p>
