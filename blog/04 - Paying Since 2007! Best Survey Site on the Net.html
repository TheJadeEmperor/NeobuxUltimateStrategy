<p>Hi <?=$nameVar?>,</p>

<p><a href="<?=$csLink?>">Clixsense</a> is one of the most reliable paying 
PTC programs out there, second only to Neobux. To make some serious 
money from Clixsense, however, you need the right strategy, otherwise, 
this can be a slow earner.</p>

<p>To help you earn money faster, I recommend you do these 3 steps right away.</p>

<br />

<br />
<p><b>Step 2 - Log in everyday</b></p>

<p>Clixsense is one of the few PTC's that reward you for being active daily. They have something called the Daily Checklist - do a few tasks and collect a 7% bonus on top of what you're earning. If you complete the Daily Checklist 3 days in a row, you will be rewarded even more. It really does pay to stay active and consistent. </p>

<p>The Daily Checklist is available in your account summary. Just click below to go to your account summary: <br />

<br />
<p><b>Step 3 - Build Your Team</b></p>

<p>You want to build your team right away because the bigger your team is, the more profit you will make. There are so many ways to earn from Clixsense it is crazy. Your referrals will bring you sign up commissions - this is a unique feature of Clixsense.
</p>

<p>When someone signs up under you, make sure to get them active right away. You earn Upgrade Commissions from your downline - this is another reason for you to upgrade. Once your downline from any 8 levels upgrades, you will receive a commission for doing nothing at all.
