<p><a href="<?=$affLink?>" target="_BLANK">Goldmoney</a> is a brand new investing platform 
    released in March of 2015 that lets users invest in gold in different currencies 
    as well as send payments to other customers using their Goldmoney account. </p>

<p>Customers can sign up on the Goldmoney platform 
    
    and buy, sell, or redeem gold using 
    <a href="<?=$affLink?>" target="_BLANK">Goldmoney</a>'s payment and settlement technology.</p>

<h2>Why Invest in Gold?</h2>

<p>Every diversified investor will tell you that investing in gold is a good idea. Gold and silver is good for long term storage and wealth building. While it's a good idea to have stocks, mutual funds, and ETF's in your portfolio, if you want to be truly diversified, you should invest in gold. </p>

<p>Unlike paper currency, gold has maintained its value throughout the ages. It is more reliable than the US Dollar, whose value is decreasing and will eventually become worthless. </p>


<p>Although the price of gold can be volatile in the short term, it has always maintained its value over the long term. Through the years, it has served as a hedge against inflation and the erosion of major currencies, and thus is an investment well worth considering.</p>


<h2>Why Use Goldmoney? </h2>

<p>Why should you use <a href="<?=$affLink?>" target="_BLANK">Goldmoney</a> when there 
    are many other companies that let you invest in gold? </p>

<p>With Goldmoney you can buy gold in different currencies. After you sign up, just make a deposit with a payment method of your choice. </p>

<p>Users can send and receive gold as payment to and from any Goldmoney user or seller for free. Gold can be sent as payment to non-Goldmoney users with email or mobile phone. </p>

<p>You can access your money at any time with a Goldmoney prepaid debit card. Since many major credit cards are accepted globally, this makes it more convenient for you to access your money. </p>

<p>Most importantly, all your money is backed by actually gold bullion. The company has gold cubes in storage in their headquarters. You can redeem these gold cubes via physical delivery. 
</p>

<p>Here are some of the key features that sets Goldmoney apart from other gold investment mediums:</p>

<h2>**Update** Goldmoney Prepaid Card</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="images/guide/goldmoney/bitgold_debit_card.jpg" width="350px" /></p>

<p>Upon request, Goldmoney will send you a prepaid debit card once you're approved. You can use this
    card like any debit card and withdraw money from an ATM (for a small fee). Use it to make
    purchases at the local supermarket or restaurant (for no fee). </p>

<p>This is in my opinion the coolest feature of Goldmoney. The card gives you instant access to the
    gold in your account, treating it like a bank, even though it is an investment account. It
    is better than waiting for the bank wire, which takes up to 3 days to process. 
    Plus, the design looks pretty cool and sleek. So if you
    can, get the Goldmoney Prepaid Card right away.</p>

<p>I just got my Goldmoney Prepaid Card in the mail a few days ago and everything works as stated. 
The wait time might be a little long, but you will receive your card eventually, so 
be patient. I recommend that right after you register for Goldmoney, apply for the
prepaid card immediately afterwards. </p>

<h2>My Final Thoughts - Is Goldmoney Legit?</h2>

<p>Over the next few weeks they will be launching the Goldmoney mobile app, which makes even more convenient for you to access your gold. Goldmoney has only launched recently and they are still new, but they have many exciting things planned.</p>

<p>Goldmoney as a company is completely transparent, and therefore they are not a scam, but rather, a legit investment opportunity. If you already are a gold investor, then there's no better place than Goldmoney. </p>

<p>The demand for gold is always high and the price is slowly increasing, so don't wait and get your gold today. Every day you wait the price of gold will increase and you will lose a little bit of your purchasing power. So don't 
wait and sign up today and reap the rewards later. </p>
