<h2>If You've Been Wrongfully Banned</h2>

<p>Firstly, let me I am terribly sorry for your loss. Over the course of a few years, we've had a handful of subscribers say that they've been wrongfully banned from Neobux. You're not alone. We feel your pain and sympathize with you, but if this happens to you,
you need to be prepared for the worst case scenario.</p>

<p>The Neobux terms of service state that you cannot have more than 1 account per IP address. Every computer in your household is under the same IP address, so if you have registered for more than 1 account on your computer, then Neobux will ban you. Sometimes it happens by accident - you forgot that you already had an account. Or maybe one of your family members registered for an account.</p>

<p> Neobux's banning policies are very strict. You need to be mentally prepared that you will never see your account again. But, if you are innocent, then send an email to Neobux support explaining what happened: 
<b><a href="mailto:tickets@neobux.com">tickets@neobux.com</a></b></p>

<p>I don't know how long it will take them to respond, if they respond at all. 
Just be patient and wait for their email. They may restore your account, they
may not, you need to be prepared for anything. </p>

<p><b>Take a deep breath and don't panic.</b> It's not the end of the world. 
Neobux is not the only money maker there is, you can join other PTC sites and
make money from them. That's why I recommend you remain active at 5-10 PTC sites
at all times, so even if you lose one account, you still have others. </p>

<h2>How to Start Over Without Buying a New Computer</h2>

<p>Even if other PTC sites are available, sometimes you must have a Neobux account. Not only is your account banned, but so is your IP address, so it may seem like you are doomed. But don't worry, I can help you with starting over without having to buy another computer.</p>

<p>First, you need to destroy any evidence of a Neobux account on your computer by doing 3 things:

1. Clearing your cookies<br />
2. Resetting your IP address<br />
3. Make new email address </p>

<p>In this article, we will go over how to do steps 1 and 2. For your convenience, we've listed instructions on how to clean your cookies on each of the modern browsers. </p>

<h2>How to Clear Cookies in Chrome</h2>

<h2>How to Clear Cookies in Firefox</h2>

<p>1. Click on the menu button in the upper right corner.</p>

<p>2. Select Options.</p>

<p>3. In the Privacy section , click on Clear your recent history. From the drop-down menu next to Time range to clear, select Everything, then click on Clear Now.</p>

<p>4. In the left-side column, click on Advanced, then go to the Network tab.</p>

<p>5. In the Cached Web Content section, click on Clear Now.</p>

<h2>How to Clear Cookies in Opera</h2>

<p>1. Open the red O and then click Settings. Alternatively you can press Alt and P together.
</p>
<p>2. Click Settings</p>

<p>3. Open the Privacy & Security tab. Now click Clear browsing data...</p>

<p>4. Clear Browsing Data - In the drop-down box select the beginning of time. Then check only Cookies and other site data and Cached images and files. Now click Clear browsing data.</p>

<p>5. Clear Data - Click on the Opera button in the top left corner > Settings > Delete Private Data...NOTE: You can also access this menu by holding Ctrl + Shift + Delete.</p>

<p>7. Click on Detailed Options to show the rest of the options. Make sure only the following are checked:</p>

<p>Delete temporary cookies<br />
Delete all cookies<br />
Delete entire cache<br />
Click on the Delete button. </p>


<h2>How to Reset Your IP Address</h2>

<p>After you clear your cookies, the next step is to reset your IP address. Once you do this, you will assume a new identity, as far as Neobux is concerned. They have no way of knowing that it's you. </p>

<p>You can renew your IP address by cycling your modem's power. Turn off both your computer and your modem (and your router, if you have one). Wait at least 5 minutes, then turn everything back on. If your computer is set to receive an IP address dynamically (the most likely configuration), you should be assigned a new IP address automatically.</p>

<p>To reset your IP on a windows computer...</p>

<p>1. Open the command prompt window. Do this by clicking the "Start" button, and then selecting "Run." </p>

<p>2. In the window that appears, type "cmd" into the text box and click the "OK" button.
3. Release the computer's current IP address. To do this, type "ipconfig /release" into the command prompt window and press Enter.</p>

<p>4. Acquire a new IP address. Do this by typing "ipconfig /renew" into the command prompt window and pressing Enter. This should assign the computer a new IP address, which will be different from the previous address.</p>

<p>Check to make sure your IP address has changed. To do this, go to this website: <a href="https://www.whatsmyip.org/" target="_BLANK">https://www.whatsmyip.org/</a></p>

<p>It is a good idea to check your IP address BEFORE these steps, so you can check that your IP has changed afterwards. </p>

<p>Finally, it's time to make a new Neobux login with a brand new email address. You should be able to login to your new account and use it as you did before. See? I told you not to panic :)</p>
