<p>In this Neobux guide, we will teach you the fundamentals of using the basic features of the website, such as upgrades and renewing referrals. Neobux is different than most PTC's in that they are more sophisticated and packed with special features. Many people who first join Neobux are confused on what to do as there are so many options available to them. This detailed guide will attempt to give you details on every membership and feature, so you can get a better understanding of how your Neobux account works. </p>

<p>Here are the topics we will cover: <br />

<h2>Standard vs Golden Membership</a></h2>

<p>When you sign up to Neobux, you begin as a standard member. After being a member for 15 days and making 100 clicks, you have the option to upgrade to different membership levels. As a standard member, you are limited to renting a total of <b>300</b> referrals. You can only buy a rental package once a week and your maximum rental package for that week is 100 referrals. </p>

<p>Standard members have a limit of 30 direct referrals whereas a Golden member can have up to 200 direct referrals. </p>

<p>An interesting thing to note about this limit is that it increases based on how many days you have been registered. However this applies only after you have been registered for 30 days. </p>

<p>So as a standard, you start with a limit of 30, and that number will increase over time. Your direct referral limit will increase by 1 every 4 days. </p>

<p>So the formula is take the number of days you've been registered and minus 30, then divide by 4, then add 30 to that. </p>

<p>Formula for Standard: </p>

<p>Referrals Limit = (Your registered days - 30)/4 + 30</p>

<p>In the formulas we minus 30 because in the first 30 days of registration the limit does not change. </p>

<p>For example, let's say you have registered 70 days ago. </p>
<p>Referrals Limit = (70 - 30) / 4 + 30</p>
<p>Referrals Limit = 40</p>


<p>Your first upgrade is available to you after you click 100 ads and have been a member for at least 15 days. A Golden membership costs $90 and with that comes many benefits that standards don't have. You are allowed to have 2,000 rented referrals and have a base of 200 direct referrals. </p>

<p>Your rental package is the same as a standard: you rent up to 100 referrals per week. One of the key benefits of being a Golden is something called vacation mode. </p>

<h3>Golden Benefit: Vacation mode </h3>  

<p>You only get credits from your referrals' clicks on the days that you click ads yourself. If you skip clicking for a day, you will lose some money. The more referrals you have, the more you potentially lose in revenue. </p>

<p>If you know you will be unable to click on certain days, you can mark them as vacation days. If they are marked, you will not lose your referral clicks for that day, as you will lose referral clicks if you do not click yourself. If one of your referrals is on vacation, they will not be auto-recycled for not clicking. </p>

<h3>Ultimate Tip</h3>
<p>Hopefully, this chart will help you get a clearer picture of the benefits of upgrading to Golden. As you can see, your personal clicks earnings stay the same pretty much. Your referral clicks earnings are doubled for every type of ad. </p>

<p>That means, if you are planning to upgrade, make sure you rent a lot of referrals and use vacation mode to your advantage. The price of $90 is a lot of money for many of you, so plan ahead before you upgrade. Follow our guides and tips in out newsletter to ensure you're on the right path on your journey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="goldenRentReferralsGuide">How to Rent Referrals as a Golden</h2>

<p>The table below displays the referral prices for AutoPay. The prices depend on how many referrals you have in your account. To pay for the referrals, just transfer funds from your regular balance to your rental balance. </p>
	
<img src="<?=$imgDir?>upgrade/neobuxPrices.jpg" alt="Neobux Referral Prices" title="Neobux Referral Prices"> 
<p>Neobux Referral Prices</p>


<p>To put money in your rental balance, click on Account Summary, then Rental Balance, and select Neobux Main Balance as the source of funds. The little gray arrows let you select the amount to transfer in increments of a dime (10 cents at a time). You can also add money via payment processors available to you. </p>

<p>Then on Account Summary / Referrals select the number to rent. The choices are 3, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 100. Please note that you can only rent referrals once a week (or once every 7 days). That is why you need to choose carefully which package you want, because if you choose the wrong package you will have to wait 7 days to rent again. </p>

<img src="<?=$imgDir?>upgrade/neobuxRent.jpg" alt="Neobux Referral Prices" />
<p>Neobux Referral Renting</p>


<p><i>Here is one major drawback of upgrading your membership that you need to be aware of before upgrading</i>: You have a limited window to rent new referrals. You can pick two time slots per day to rent. There are a limited number of rentals given each hour, so you will need to be clicking as soon as the time slot opens to ensure you get referrals.  Many members complain that they are never able to rent referrals after upgrading.  There are methods that will make this easier, such as picking non-peak hours. Depending on how dedicated you are to Neobux, you may be better off sticking with a standard membership.</p>

<p>You can try to rent on specific hours that you choose. The referral packs will be released exactly on the hour, but the demand is so high that all referral packs are sold out in less than 5 seconds. </p>

<p>Many Golden members have recommended these steps to ensure you get your referrals
</p>

<p><?=$X_img?> Set two times that you want to try to rent referrals in your account, save the changes by entering your password at the bottom of the page. </p>

<p><img src="<?=$imgBlog?>upgrade/goldenRentReferrals.jpg" alt="Neobux Golden Rent Referrals" /></p>


<p><?=$X_img?> Login to Neobux 5 minutes before your rental time, close all other programs on your PC and anything that uses a lot of bandwidth. </p>

<p><?=$X_img?> Make sure you have enough money in your rental balance</p>

<p><?=$X_img?> Open this clock showing your country's time, in a new tab:
<a href="http://time.is/" target="_BLANK">http://time.is/</a></p>

<p><?=$X_img?> Open the Renting page in a new tab:
<a href="https://www.neobux.com/c/rar/" target="_BLANK">https://www.neobux.com/c/rar/</a></p>

<p><?=$X_img?> Keep an eye on the Internet Clock and 1 second before your chosen rental time, refresh the Renting page by pressing F5 on the keyboard. For example if you rent at 21:00, refresh it at 20:59 and 59 seconds. If you don't see available packs, try for 2-3 more times to refresh the page. If you fail you have to try at your next rental time or tomorrow at the same hours.
</p>



<h3>The Alernative Method: Rental Queue </h3> 

<p>As mentioned above, once you upgrade you will only have a certain window to rent referrals, and if referrals get sold out during your window, you will have to wait until your next time slot. A referral queue allows you to reserve referrals at 1.5 times the cost of doing it the regular way. You will automatically be delivered your referrals, instead of needing to be at your computer at the exact time frantically clicking. </p>

<p>But since using the rental queue is more expensive, it is not recommended to use this method as a Golden. Try to rent the regular way using the steps we outlined above. Hopefully you will be able to get your referral package on time. </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="neobuxAutoRenew">Special Feature: Automatic Renewal</h2>

<p>AutoRenew is the automatic renewal process of your rented referrals. Contrary to AutoPay which will work only when a referral makes his/her first click for a day and will extend for one day the referral's deadline, AutoRenew works every day (*) and prolongs your referral's deadline based on your chosen renewal period and time before expiration.</p>

<p>(*) AutoRenew will only be attempted for each referral once per day. If you have no funds in your rental and / or main balance or some unexpected error occurs, 
the referral(s) that weren't renewed will be only checked again approximately 24 hours after. We advise you to choose a higher number of days between the first renewal check and the referrals'deadline, so that you'll have the most chances of getting all referrals automatically renewed. It's your responsibility to have enough funds for the renewals and always check if any referral has failed to be renewed automatically.</p>

<p>The concept is simple, Rented Referrals automatically renew when their remaining days 
drop below a specified time. The funds will automatically be deducted from your account at the time of renewal. If funds are not available, the referrals will eventually expire.</p>

<img src="<?=$imgDir?>upgrade/autorenew.png" alt="Neobux Guide - AutoRenew Referrals" width="90%">

<p>After specifying your settings, all referrals will be automatically renewed. We recommend you renew for the max of 240 days because you will get the max discount. </p>

<p>The renewal prices are based upon the initial renting prices and each level has a higher discount: <br /> 
15 days = 0% discount <br />
30 days = 5% discount<br />
60 days = 10% discount<br />
90 days = 18% discount<br />
150 days = 25% discount<br />
240 days = 30% discount
</p>


<h3 align="left">Ultimate Tip:</h3> 

<p>In the beginning you may not have much in your balance, so you have determine which renewal strategy (90, 150 or 240 days) you can afford. Build up your balance so you can get to renew for 240 days.</p>

<p>Eventually your goal is to renew for 240 days, because that requires less work and has the most savings. As an Ultimate member, this will remove any reason to do anything but view your required advertisements for the day. </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Neobux Feature: Automatic Recycling</h2>

<p>After a certain period of time of inactivity, referrals are automatically recycled. 
Inactivity is deemed as a referral not viewing ANY ads within a specified time period. 
Here is a chart breaking down the different time periods: 
<ul>
<li>Standard - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Golden - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Emerald - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Sapphire - 12 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Platinum - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Diamond - 10 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Ultimate - 7 days of inactivity</li>
</ul></p>


<p>Before this excellent innovation, referrals that were deemed inactive had to be replaced by clicking on the Rented Referral Screen. Then you were required to refresh the screen multiple times for it to take effect. This is no longer the case.</p>

<p>As soon as a referral is deemed inactive, it will be marked inactive and replaced automatically.</p>

<p>One of the excellent benefits of this innovation is in conjunction with Vacation Mode. 
When on Vacation mode in the earlier system, all inactive referrals would stay inactive 
and not be replaced, until you logged in and viewed the Referral Page. 
This would negatively affect your average. Now when Vacation is activated, 
your inactive referrals are automatically recycled.</p>  


<br><br>

<h3>Golden Packs</h3>

<p>Golden Packs are available after becoming a Golden Member. The most expensive upgrade is of course, the Ultimate membership. But for those who can't afford it, there are in between upgrades called golden packs that cost less but have more features than golden.</p>
