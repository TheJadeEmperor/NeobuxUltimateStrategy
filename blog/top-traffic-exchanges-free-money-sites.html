<p>Many of you have asked us what are the top traffic exchange sites to join? Over the years we have tried many traffic exchanges. Some were good but most of them were mediocre and did not deliver the results that we wanted. After much trial and error we narrowed the list down to only 3 top traffic exchanges we use over and over.
