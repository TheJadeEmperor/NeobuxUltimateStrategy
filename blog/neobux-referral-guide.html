<p>In this Neobux guide, we will teach you the fundamentals of using the basic features of the website, such as upgrades
and renewing referrals. Neobux is different than most PTC's in that they are more sophisticated and packed with special features. Many people who first join Neobux are confused on what to do as there are so many options available to them. </p>

<h3>Referral Renting - How to Do It</h3>

<p>The table below displays the initial referral prices. The prices depend on how many referrals you already have in your account. The more you have, the more each one will cost you. </p>

<p>To pay for the referrals, just transfer funds from your regular balance to your rental balance. </p>

<p>To do this, click on Account Summary ==> Rental Balance then select Neobux Main Balance as the source 
of funds (You could also add money by PayPal, AlertPay, or Neteller) You will then see the image below. 
The little gray arrows let you select the amount to transfer in increments of a dime 
(10 cents at a time). </p>

<p>Then on Account Summary / Referrals select the number to rent. The choices are 3, 10, 20, 
30, 50, 70, and 100. Please note that you can only rent referrals once a week (or once every
7 days). That is why you need to choose carefully which package you want, because if you
choose the wrong package you will have to wait 7 days to rent again. </p>

<p>You only get credits from your referrals' clicks on the days that you click ads yourself. 
If you skip clicking for a day, you will lose some money. The more referrals you have, the
more you potentially lose in revenue. </p>

<p></p>


<h3>Special Feature: Automatic Renewal</h3>

<p>Neobux released a new feature called AutoRenew on January 12th, 2011.</p>

<p>AutoRenew is the automatic renewal process of your rented referrals. Contrary to AutoPay which 
will work only when a referral makes his/her first click for a day and will extend for one day 
the referral's deadline, AutoRenew works every day (*) and prolongs your referral's deadline 
based on your chosen renewal period and time before expiration.</p>

<p>The concept is simple, Rented Referrals automatically renew when their remaining days 
drop below a specified time. The funds will automatically be deducted from your account at the 
time of renewal. If funds are not available, the referrals will eventually expire.</p>

<img src="<?=$imgLink?>autorenew.png" alt="Neobux Guide - AutoRenew Referrals" width="90%">

<p>After specifying your settings, all referrals will be automatically renewed. 
With the advent of Automatic Recycling, viewing the rented referral screen now seems useless. 
I currently have AutoRenew activated for 150 day renewal and 3 days before expiration. 
I like and activated AutoRenew because I no longer have to worry about referrals 
accidentally expiring. NeoBux Admin thought through many improvements, 
and the NeoBux team finally started implementing these improvements. </p>

<p>The renewal / extension prices are based upon the initial renting prices:<br>
15 days = 0% discount <br>
30 days = 5% discount<br>
60 days = 10% discount<br>
90 days = 18% discount<br>
150 days = 25% discount<br>
240 days = 30% discount
</p>


<p>(*) AutoRenew will only be attempted for each referral once per day. 
If you have no funds in your rental and / or main balance or some unexpected error occurs, 
the referral(s) that weren't renewed will be only checked again approximately 24 hours after. 
We advise you to choose a higher number of days between the first renewal check and the referrals'
deadline, so that you'll have the most chances of getting all referrals automatically renewed. 
It's your responsibility to have enough funds for the renewals and always check if any referral 
has failed to be renewed automatically.</p>

<h2 align="left">Ultimate Tip:</h2> 
<p>Determine which renewal strategy (90, 150 or 240 days) you can afford, and setup AutoRenew. 
As an Ultimate member, this will remove any reason to do anything but view your required 
advertisements for the day. </p>

<h3>Neobux Feature: Automatic Recycling</h3>

<p>After a certain period of time of inactivity, referrals are automatically recycled. 
Inactivity is deemed as a referral not viewing ANY ads within a specified time period. 
Here is a chart breaking down the different time periods: 
<ul>
<li>Standard - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Golden - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Emerald - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Sapphire - 12 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Platinum - 14 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Diamond - 10 days of inactivity</li>
<li>Ultimate - 7 days of inactivity</li>
</ul></p>


<p>Before this excellent innovation, referrals that were deemed inactive 
had to be replaced by clicking on the Rented Referral Screen. 
Then you were required to refresh the screen multiple times for it to take effect.
This is no longer the case.</p>

<p>As soon as a referral is deemed inactive, it will be marked inactive and replaced automatically.</p>

<p>One of the excellent benefits of this innovation is in conjunction with Vacation Mode. 
When on Vacation mode in the earlier system, all inactive referrals would stay inactive 
and not be replaced, until you logged in and viewed the Referral Page. 
This would negatively affect your average. Now when Vacation is activated, 
your inactive referrals are automatically recycled.</p>
