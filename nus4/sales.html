<p class="p-bold">Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Neobux is one of the internet's most innovative and lucrative money making PTC's. They have been in operation for over 11 years and they always pay their members on time. With a low $2 cashout, and the ability to rent referrals who earn for you, everyone's making money, right?</p><br /><br />

<h2>Absolutely Not!!</h2><br />
<p>There's a different side to the truth that we don't want to admit. It's the darker side of PTC's...most people are not making money...but rather,they are working too hard to earn too little money. But wait, aren't lots of people making ultra profits from Neobux? Sure, you hear success stories and see payment proofs of those users who are making it big...</p>

<p class="p-italic">But what about most other users - people like you and me?</p>

<p>The ugly truth of the matter is, most people who join PTC's, also known as "<span class="p-bold">pay to click</span>" sites, barely make any money, and those who've invested money come out at a loss. Many of those who try PTC's do so with the right intentions...they work hard patiently, hoping to eventually make profit. But after months of hard work, they are not seeing results, become frustrated, and ultimately give up.</p><br /><br />

<h2 class="p-red">And it's not their fault!</h2><br />

<p>We have seen so many good people quit these programs out of sheer frustration that it saddens me...yet that is the reality of the system.
</p>

<p>One very important part of success is direct referrals. But they are not that easy to get...you have to promote, promote, promote. And after all that work, you still didn't get any referrals.</p><br /><br />

<h3>Does getting referrals feel like this?</h3><br />

<div class="image">
	<img src="<?=$spImg?>frustrate.jpg">
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="p-red">So why do most people fail in PTC's?</h2><br />
<p>The answer is simple: they do not have a working strategy. They joined Neobux with unrealistic expectations, hoping to make it rich quick. But when they realize that it is not making money fast, they start to become frustrated and lose hope. <span class="p-italic">If this is you right now, then you are at the right place - keep reading and don't miss a word.</span></p>

<p>You've probably tried to find the answer on Google - but found nothing - and you continued to search frantically, hoping to find the key that will solve all your problems. After reading some strategies, you tried to implement them, but none of them worked.</p>

<p>My name is Benjamin Louie, and I have been using PTC's for over 4 years now. I understand your frustration - <span class="p-bold">because I've been there.</span> I know what it's like to click diligently everyday and do what I'm "supposed" to do, but whenever I stare at my account balance, I wonder if the work I put in is worth it.</p><br /><br />


<h2 class="p-red">Introducing the Ultimate Strategy</h2><br />

<p>In the Neobux Ultimate Strategy course, I'm going to show you what the top 10% of Neobux users are doing to make <span class="p-bold">tremendous profits</span> in Neobux...and it works for <span class="p-bold">any</span> Pay to Click site. The principles are the same no matter what program you are in.</p>

<p>With this strategy, you can say goodbye to the following problems:</p>
	
<ul>
	<li><img src="<?=$spImg?>check.png"> No more wondering why you aren't profiting, even though you have rented referrals</p></li>
	<li><img src="<?=$spImg?>check.png"> No more struggling to find direct referrals</li>
	<li><img src="<?=$spImg?>check.png"> No more wondering if you are recycling the right way</li>
	<li><img src="<?=$spImg?>check.png"> No more staring at your account balance and being disappointed</li>
</ul><br /><br />

	
<p>Does this describe you...</p>

<p>You join Neobux with much excitement, and you click on ads diligently like you're supposed to. Then you rent some referrals (which took you a while, since you make 0.001 per click) and hope that they click actively and earn for you. But those referrals become inactive, and you recycle them, hoping the new ones will be better. By now, even if you have lots of referrals, you still have to constantly replace them, and <span class="p-italic">you're barely making any profits.</span></p>

<p>Then you become frustrated and eventually give up.</p>

<p>Aren't <span class="p-under">you </span> tired of living in this vicious cycle of failure? Don't you wish there was a way out?</p>
<p>You're probably skeptical right now, wondering how much is all this going to cost you. But before we get there, let me ask you something...</p><br /><br />

<h2>How much money have you made from Neobux?</h2><br />
<p>Hopefully, the answer is "not enough" - if that's the case, then keep reading. The Neobux Ultimate Strategy will be the answer to all your problems</p><br /><br />

<h2 class="p-red">Want Proof? Then look at all these referrals...</h2><br />

<p>Another reason to sign up ... from time to time we will announce discounts on our products, up to 50% off. We don't run these special offers often, but when we do we announce them through our newsletters.</p>

<p>The only way you can miss out is to not take action...you can make money or make excuses, but not both. Hopefully you've decided to do the right thing and take action - and we will see you on the other side.</p><br /><br />

<p class="p-vsmall"><span class="p-bold">P.S.</span> Countless Neobux members have gotten their hands on this and are making a killing! <?=$itemPriceDisplay?> is a small price to pay if you are serious about earning money with Neobux.</p>

<p class="p-vsmall"><span class="p-bold">P.P.S. </span>Remember - this price is guaranteed for <span class="p-bold">today</span> only. We've increased the price before and will do it again. We'll keep it here at least until midnight tonight (EST), but make no promise about what it might cost you tomorrow.</p>
