<h2 id="resellerLicense">I Want to Resell the eBook in Another Language</h2>
<p>That's what we like to see, ambition! If the eBook becomes international, it will 
benefit us even more. That is why we have a reseller program like no other! If you 
know Spanish, German, French, or any other languages, and you are passionate about 
spreading our message, then this is for you. </p>

<p><u>Reseller License</u>: we will give you the rights to the ebook - and you may do whatever you wish with it - you can modify it, rebrand it, claim it as your own - it is up to you. Reseller licenses cost a one time fee of $47. </p>

<p>If you are interested in our reseller program, then please contact us at this email address: <u><a href="<?=$supportEmail?>"><?=$supportEmail?></a></u></p>

<h2 id="salesProcess">How Does the Buying Process Work?</h2>

<p>The sales process begins when you click the big "Order Now" Button from our sales page. From there, you will be taken to Paypal, where you can login and make your payment.</p>

<p>After your purchase is confirmed, you will see a screen that looks like this:</p>

<center><img src="<?=$faqDir?>payment.jpg" alt="Payment" border="1" /></center>

<p>You will see a button that says Return to Merchant. It is crucial that you click this link to return to our website. Many people overlook this and as a result, do not receive their downloads right away.</p>

<p>When you click on Return to Merchant, you will be redirected back to your download link.</p>

<center><img src="<?=$faqDir?>downloadLink.jpg" alt="Download link" width="650px" border="1" /></center>

<p>Once you see this screen, you may now click on the link to download the eBooks. Right click on the link, and select "Save As" and save it on your computer.</p>

<p>On the same screen, you will see your unique username and password, generated by the system upon your purchase. </p>

<p>You can login here: <a href="<?=$dir?>members">Members Login</a></p>

<p>After you login, you can watch the video course and download your bonuses. </p>

<h2 id="noDownload">Help, I Did Not Receive My Download!</h2>

<p>After you make the purchase from Paypal, you need to click on "Return to Merchant" to be redirected back to the download link. If you close Paypal, then you will not be redirected.</p>

<p>Our system will automatically email you the product immediately after your purchase. Please make sure you add <u><?=$supportEmail?></u> to your safelist. If you do not receive the email, please check your spam folder. If you still do not receive the email, please contact us and we will send you the download link.</p>

<p>Or, you can go directly to the download link on your browser: 
<a href="http://neobuxultimatestrategy.com/?action=download&id=transactionID">http://neobuxultimatestrategy.com/?action=download&id=<b>transactionID</b></a></p>

<p>Where transactionID is your Paypal transaction id.</p>

<h2 id="cantOpenEbook">Help, I Can't Open the eBooks!</h2>

<p>The <?=$itemName?> is in ZIP format. You will need a program such as 
<a href="http://www.win-rar.com/" target="_blank">WinRar</a> or <a href="http://winzip.com" target="_blank">WinZip</a> to extract the files. </p>
<p>The eBooks themselves are in PDF format. You will need a PDF reader such as Adobe to open them.</p>

<center><img src="<?=$faqDir?>zip1.jpg" border="1" />
	<br />
	<img src="<?=$faqDir?>zip2.jpg"></center>

<p>Links: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.win-rar.com/" target="_blank">WinRar</a> - Open RAR and ZIP files<br />
	<a href="http://winzip.com" target="_blank">WinZip</a> - Open ZIP files<br />
	<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank">Adobe PDF</a> - Open PDF files
</p>


<p>WinZip and WinRar are completely free to use and safe to install on your system. They are file archivers, meaning they group together files and compress them, to reduce their file size. Archivers make it easy for people to transfer groups of files to one another.</p>
		
<p>Once you've downloaded and installed the software, you can now extract the zip file. Right click on the file and click "Extract to download\NeobuxUltimateStrategy\"</p>

<p>After that, a new folder will be created where the ebook files are. Open the folder, and the ebooks will be in there.</p>

<h2 id="downloadExpired">Help, My Download Link Expired!</h2>
<p>From the time you make your purchase, you have <?=$expires?> hours before the download expires. This is all done automatically with our website script. Links expire to prevent hackers and/or cheaters from getting the eBook for free. If necessary, we will extend the expiration date for you. </p>

<h2 id="whatLanguage">What Language is the NUS Video Course? </h2>

<p>The PDF and the bonuses are all written in English. Luckily for you, if you do not speak English, you can use Google Translator to translate these documents into your language.</p>

<p><a href="https://translate.google.com" target="_blank">https://translate.google.com</a></p>

<p>The video tutorials are in English only. Fortunately for you, the videos are in Youtube format, so you can use the captions options in Youtube to translate the audio to whatever language you want. </p>

<p>If you are not sure how to do this, please contact us at our support email.</p>

<p class="note">*Note: Even though the videos are in Youtube format, they are private videos, so only customers have access to them.</p>

<h2 id="notSure">I'm Interested in Buying, But I'm Not Sure...</h2>

<p>This is a very common concern when people shop on the internet. Considering how much things costs these days, $<?= $itemPrice ?> is not a lot of money. The amount that you will invest into Neobux (if you are serious) will be much more than $<?=$itemPrice ?>. If you are going to invest money into a program, you might as well have a strategy.</p>

<p>We won't force you to buy anything you don't want to. It is up to you to decide if the price is worth it. </p>
