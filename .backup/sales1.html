<p><b>Dear Friend,</b></p>

<p><b><font face="tahoma" size="6">N</font></b><font face="Georgia">eobux is one of the internet's 
	most innovative and lucrative money making PTC's. They have been in operation for 5 years and 
	they always pay their members on time. With a low $2 cashout, and the ability
	to rent referrals who earn for you, everyone's making money, right? </p>

<p align="center"><b>Not Really! </b></p>

	<p>There's a different side to the truth that we don't want to admit. It's the darker side of 
	PTC's...most people are not making money...but rather,<i>they are working too hard to earn too 
	little money</i>. But wait, aren't lots of people making ultra profits from Neobux? 
	Sure, you hear success stories and see payment proofs of those users who are making it big...</p>
	
<p><i>But what about most other users</i> - people like you and me? </p>

<p>The ugly truth of the matter is, most people who join PTC's, also known as 
	"<b>pay to click</b>" sites, barely make any money, and those who've invested money come out at a 
	<b>loss</b>. Many of those who try PTC's do so with the right intentions...they work hard patiently, 
	hoping to eventually make profit. But after <i>months</i> of hard work, they are not seeing results, 
	become frustrated, and ultimately give up. </p>

<h2>And it's not their fault.</h2>

<p>We have seen so many good people quit these programs out of sheer
frustration that it saddens us...yet that is the reality of the system.</p>

<p>One very important part of success is direct referrals. But they are not that easy to get...
you have to promote, promote, promote. And after all that work, you still didn't get any referrals.</p>

<center><p>Does getting referrals feel like this?</p>
<img src="images/sales/frustrated.jpg" alt="Neobux Direct Referrals" title="Neobux Direct Referrals"></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>So why do most people fail in PTC's?</h2>

<p align="left">The answer is simple: they do not have a working strategy. 
They joined Neobux with unrealistic expectations, hoping to make it rich quick. But
when they realize that it is not making money fast, they start to become 
frustrated and lose hope. <i>If this is you right now, then you are at the right place - 
keep reading and don't miss a word.</i></p>

<p>You've probably tried to find the answer on google - but found nothing - and 
you continued to search frantically, hoping to find the key that will solve
all your problems. Afte reading some strategies, you tried to implement them,
but none of them worked.</p></font>

<p>Our names are Benjamin Louie &amp; Alper Aribal, and we have been using PTC's for over 3 years now. 
We understand your frustration - because we have been there. We know what it's like to 
to work extremely hard at PTC's and not get the results. We had click everyday diligently, 
rent referrals and try to do the "math" ... but when we stare at our account 
balances, we wonder if the work we do is worth it. </p>

<p>We began to ask ourselves, what was we doing wrong? What was we doing differently than others who were
successful? We began searching for the answer...and we found bits and pieces of information that helped,
but never a complete solution. So we continued to search frantically. And what we discovered shocked us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Introducing the Ultimate Strategy</h2>

<p align="left">In the Neobux Ultimate Strategy course, we are going to show you what the <i>top 10%</i> of
Neobux users are doing to make <b>tremendous profits</b> in Neobux...and it works for <b>any pay to click site</b>. 
The principles are the same no matter what program you are in.</p>
</font>

<p>With this strategy, you can say goodbye to the following problems: </p>

<p align="left">
<ul class="crossList">
<li><p>No more wondering why you aren't profiting, even though you have rented referrals</p></li>
<li><p>No more struggling to find direct referrals</p></li>
<li><p>No more wondering if you are recycling the right way</p></li>
<li><p>No more staring at your account balance and being disappointed</p></li>
</ul></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Does this describe you...</p>

<p>You join Neobux with much excitement, and you click on ads diligently like you're supposed to. 
Then you rent some referrals (which took you a while, since you make 0.001 per click) and hope that they
click actively and earn for you. But those referrals become inactive, and you recycle them, hoping the
new ones will be better. By now, even though you have lots of referrals, you still have to constantly
replace them, and you're barely making any profits profit. </p>

<p>Then you become frustrated and eventually give up.</p>

<p>Aren't <u>you</u> tired of living in this vicious cycle of failure? Don't you want a way out? </p>


<p>You're probably skeptical right now, wondering how much is all this going to cost you. But before
we get there, let us ask you something...</p>

<p><b>How much money have you made from Neobux? </b></p>


<p>Hopefully, the answer is "not enough" - if that's the case, then keep reading. The Neobux Ultimate
Strategy will be the answer to all your problems </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Want Proof? Then look at all these referrals...</h2>

<h2>Does This Work with Multi Level PTC's?</h2>

<p>1200+ Referrals for Hits4Pay</p>

<h2>Your Peers Have Spoken</h2>

<p>You've seen the proof - Golden members in Neobux said they have gotten a lot out of this ebook. It shouldn't even be called an ebook, it is more like a complete solution to your problems. There are no abstract solutions - all strategies have been tried and tested and have worked for many customers <i>around the world</i>... </p>

<p>If you close this window, <i>you truly don't know what you're missing out on</i>. Many Neobux 
members have already gotten their hands on this valuable information and they are using it
to reap in profits. Those who have the ebook will never be lost again when they join a 
new PTC, because they have learned the solid strategies from the ebook. </p>

<p>Imagine never being frustrated with PTC's again! Imagine joining a new PTC with 
full confidence that you can succeed and come out a winner! Wouldn't that be worth at least hunderds or thousands fo dollars? </p>
<p>But you're not going to pay anywhere near that much.</p>

<p>The Neobux Ultimate Strategy is available for $38.00 a month- but let's take a look at what you're actually getting for your money. Here are the benefits of your Monthly Membership to our NUS System:

So we have developed a really bulletproof system that will pull money in your pockets like faucet! You will get the motivation we have FROM US PERSONALLY!!! We are warning you - this is not a quick-rich-system - it`s our hard work we have done over the years &amp; now we will show you how you can do it in a better way :) We are serving you a big bunch of useful IM Ressources on a silver tablet my friends! ;-) We believe that you don`t need to pay a fortune for becoming successful on the internet. </p>
<p align="left">We will not let you buy our product - let you pay month for month without giving you any support.</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS FRIENDS!!!</strong></p>
<p align="left">We want your success cause if you succeed with our system this will give us reputation - show that we have done something right. We are not interested in this sheme of relationship</p>
<p><strong> SELLER = CUSTOMER </strong>(very unpersonal) </p>
<p>We are more!</p>
<p>We are thinking like this</p>
<p><strong>FRIENDS = FRIENDS  </strong>(very personal) </p>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">So....i guess every stone is turned on this site. So let`s recap everything again. The stuff we have talked above are our whole experiences we have made in 6 years of being online. It`s our baby - our LIFEBLOOD! </p>
<p>I'm not the fastest horse in the bunch, but I know a deal when I see one.
