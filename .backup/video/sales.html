<p><b>Dear Fellow PTC User,</b></p>

<p><b><font face="tahoma" size="6">M</font></b>aking money online seems to be getting harder and 
	harder, isn't it? PTC Programs, also called "pay to click" sites, are getting more and more
	popular over the years. </p>

<p>What's so attractive about PTC's is that they make it seem so easy. You don't need any experience whatsoever. All you need is a computer with an internet connection and be able to click a few ads here and there. </p>

<p>However, because it seems so "easy", most people underestimate what they need to do, and 
	end up failing. The ugly truth of the matter is most people who join PTC's 
barely make any money, and those who've invested money come out at a <b>loss</b>. 

<p>Many of those who try PTC's do so with the right intentions...
they work hard patiently, hoping to eventually make profit. But after <i>months</i> of hard work, 
they are not seeing results, become frustrated, and ultimately give up. </p> </font>

<p>And do you know the biggest reason they fail?</p>

<h2>No Direct Referrals</h2>
 
<p>That's right. Not all PTC's are created equal. But they all have one thing in common - you
	can earn money from direct referrals. But they are not that easy to get...
you have to promote, promote, promote. And after all that work, you still didn't get any referrals.</p>

<center>
<p>Does getting referrals feel like this?</p>
<img src="<?=$imgDir?>frustrated.jpg" alt="Neobux Direct Referrals" title="Neobux Direct Referrals">
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why is Getting Direct Referrals So Hard?</h2>

<p>The answer is simple: they do not have a working strategy. 
They joined Neobux with unrealistic expectations, hoping to make it rich quick. But
when they realize that it is not making money fast, they start to become 
frustrated and lose hope.</p>

<p><i> If this describes you right now, then you are at the right place - 
keep reading and don't miss a word.</i></p>

<p>You've probably tried to find the answer on some blog or random website - and you
searched frantically, hoping to find that one answer that will solve all your problems.
Afte reading some strategies, you tried different ways to recycle referrals, renew
referrals, and renting referrals. But none of them seem to produce the results
you wanted. </p></font>

<p>My name is Benjamin, and I have been using PTC's for over 3 years now. 
I understand your frustration - because I've been there. I know what it's like to 
to work extremely hard with PTC's and not get the results. I'd click everyday diligently, 
rent referrals and try to do the "math" ... but when I stare at my account 
balance, I wonder if the work I do is worth it. </p>

<p>I began to ask myself, what was I doing wrong? What was I doing differently than others who were
successful? I began searching for the answer...and I found bits and pieces of information that helped,
but never a complete solution. So I continued to search frantically. And what I discovered shocked me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>This is Ultimate Strategy of PTC's</h2>

<p>Now that we've gotten the facts out of the way, we can get straight down to business. Have you heard of the Neobux Ultimate Strategy guide? If you are on this website, then chances are you have. </p>

<p>In the NUS Guide, I've shown you how to set up a system to get tons of referrals on auto-pilot, how to recycle wisely so that you only have active clickers, and where to promote your links to get the best results. </p>

<p>Due to popular demand from subscribers and customers, we have released a brand new product: </p>

<h2>Introducing the <?=$itemName?></h2>

<center>
	<img src="<?=$courseDir?>video-course-cover.jpg" alt="NUS Video Course" title="NUS Video Course" />
</center>

<p>In the Video Course, I am going to show you step by step how to implement the strategies in the NUS - so you will
equipped with the knowledge and know-how to take your business to the next level. </p>

<p>All PTC's have one thing in common - the ability to get direct referrals. If you know how to do that easily, then any PTC will be a breeze for you. If you don't know, then you will struggle time and time again. I know the feeling too well - working too much to get too little results. </p>

<p>The NUS Video Course will show you what I did to generate an endless stream of referrals who click day in and day out. I understand if you're skeptical. But here's some proof: </p>



<h2>Please browse the gallery to see all my referrals</h2>


<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="../include/js/swfobject.js" ></script>

<!-- Div that contains gallery. -->
<div id="gallery">
<h1>No flash player!</h1>
<p>It looks like you don't have flash player installed. <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" >Click here</a> to go to Macromedia download page.</p>
</div>

<!-- Script that embeds gallery. -->
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
var so = new SWFObject("../nus/flashgallery.swf", "gallery", "700", "600", "8"); // Location of SWF file. You can change gallery width and height here (using pixels or percents).
so.addParam("quality", "high");
so.addParam("allowFullScreen", "true");
so.addParam("wmode", "transparent");
so.addVariable("content_path", "../images/refs/"); // Location of folder with JPG and PNG files (relative to php script).
so.addVariable("color_path", "../nus/default.xml"); // Location of XML file with settings.
so.addVariable("script_path", "../include/flashgallery.php"); // Location of PHP script.
so.write("gallery");
</script>

<p align="center">Make sure you have flash installed to view the gallery.</p>


<p>As you can see, I have tons of referrals for PTC sites like Neobux and Onbux. It
	even works for multi-level PTC's like Clixzing, Clixsense, and PeopleString. 
	At the time of writing, I already had 800 referrals for PeopleString. Imagine what
	my account looks like today? </p>

<p>A picture is truly worth a thousand words...</p>
</center>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want these kinds of results then the Video Course is for you. </p>


<h2>What is included in the video course?</h2>

<ul class="checkList">
<li><b>How to set up a PTC system that allows you to get referrals on auto-pilot, set it and forget it!
</b></li>

<br />

<li><i>How to make yourself the authority to your subscribers, and have them hungry for your offers, practically begging to be your referrals</i></li>

<br />

<li><b>A cheap, affordable way to get referrals instantly without doing "complicated" work - in other words, how to spend a little bit and get a lot
</b></li>

<br />

<li><i> A hidden trick that virtually no one knows about that can double your referral sign-ups instantly
 </i></li>
 
<br />

<li><b>How to get 40+ direct referrals virtually overnight for any PTC you want
</b></li>

<br />

<li><i>How to determine which referrals are profitable and which ones to recycle, leaving you an army of active clickers </i></li>
<br />
<li><b>Also included in the package are a bunch of bonus ebooks</b> </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're probably skeptical right now, wondering how much is all this going to cost you. But before
we get there, let me ask you something...</p>

<p><b>Are you one of those users who make less than $100 a month from PTC's?</b></p>

<p>Now that I have your attention, keep reading, because it only gets better. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the video course I am going to show you a little trick you can use to <i>drastically increase
	your sign up rate overnight. </i></p>

<p>I will show you an example. </p>

<p>When I first applied the trick, I checked my email 1 hour later. By that time
	I already had 11 Clixsense referrals. </p>
	
<center>
	<img src="<?=$refDir?>clixsenseA.jpg" alt="Clixsense Referrals" title="Clixsense Referrals" />
</center>

<br /><br />
<p>That's already pretty good for doing almost nothing, but the real magic begins 2 days later.
	I have not checked my account for 2 days. And when I opened my email I saw this</p>
<br /><br />

<center>
	<img src="<?=$refDir?>clixsenseB.jpg" alt="Clixsense Referrals" title="Clixsense Referrals" /> 
</center>

<br />

<p>Wow, what a discovery I've made! 70 referrals in 2 days - and it all came from applying that
	1 little trick, which will be revealed in the course. </p>

<p><i>That's literally 35 referrals per day. I was not kidding when I say you can get tons of 
	referrals overnight.</i> </p>

<p>For an old site like Clixsense, getting referrals is hard. But if you have the right strategy,
	it is easy. Just follow the steps in our course and watch the referrals pour in! </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>All PTC's Have This One Thing in Common</h2>


<p>Face it, the single most important thing in any PTC (and the thing they all have in common) is 
	the ability to get direct referrals. Everything else is secondary. </p>

<p>If you are smart then you'll realize this is true. Once you master this process of getting
	direct referrals - once your system is set up - then you'll start seeing massive results -
	results that you never thought you would see. </p>
	
<p>With direct referrals comes everything else - more money in your balance, more confidence
	in your abilities, and more importantly, a sense of relief. </p>
	
<p>You probably have a lot of questions in your head right now...good! It means 
	that you actually see some posibilities for yourself. Keep reading...</p>
	
<h2>Here's a Breakdown of the <?=$itemName?></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<? include('videoModules.html'); ?>


<p>That's a total of 11 videos in 5 training modules. Every video has been designed with the end
	user in mind - so that it's easy to follow. You can re-watch the videos at anytime and learn
	at your own pace.</p>
	
	<p>But wait, there's still more... </p>


<h2>Bonus eBooks Included</h2>

<p>To make the offer even better for you, we've included some bonus ebooks in the 
	product. What product would be complete without bonuses? </p>

<center>
<h3>Bonus #1: PTC Riches</h3>
<img src="<?=$courseDir?>bonus-ebook-1.jpg" alt="Bonus Ebook 1" title="Bonus Ebook 1" />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bonus #2: PTC Income Today</h3>
<img src="<?=$courseDir?>bonus-ebook-2.jpg" alt="Bonus Ebook 2" title="Bonus Ebook 2" />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bonus #3: The Pizza Plan</h3>
<img src="<?=$courseDir?>bonus-ebook-3.jpg" alt="Bonus Ebook 3" title="Bonus Ebook 3" />
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the 5 video training series above, you will get these 3 bonuses 
	absolutely free, just for trying the <?=$itemName?> </p>

<p>But of course, even with all this proof of success, there's still one more question lurking 
	in your head. "Will this actually make me money?"</p>

<p>I'm going to let you answer your own question by showing you this screen shot of my paypal
	account: </p>

<center>
	<img src="<?=$courseDir?>paypal.jpg" border="1" />
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've shown you the referrals, and I've shown you the money. So the rest is up to you - you have
	to decide if the video course is for you. Don't you want a balance like that? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you close this window, <i>you truly don't know what you're missing out on</i>. Many Neobux 
members have already gotten their hands on this valuable information and they are using it
to reap in profits. Those who have the ebook will never be lost again when they join a 
new PTC, because they have learned the solid strategies from the ebook. </p>

<p>Imagine never being frustrated with PTC's again! Imagine joining a new PTC with full confidence that you can succeed and come out a winner! Wouldn't that kind of system be worth $97 or more?</p>

<center>
	<p>But we're not going to charge you that much. <br />
		$97 is a lot of money for most people. </p>

	<p>We're not going to charge you $87 </p>
	
	<p>Not even $77...or $67</p>
	
	<p>The retail price of the <?=$itemName?> is only <b>$37.00</b> </p>

	<p><b>But, that's not the final price.</b> </p>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Special Limited-Time Offer for Our Subscribers</h2>

<p>For a limited time we are going to give it away for $<?=$itemPrice ?> - that's
	55% off!</p>
	
<p>See the timer at the top of the page? Once 
	the timer hits 0, the price will go back up to $37</p>

<p>So, do you want to pay less or pay more? It's a no brainer, isn't it?</p>
