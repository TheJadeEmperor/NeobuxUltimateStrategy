<p><b>Dear PTC User,</b></p>

<p><b><font face="tahoma" size="6">N</font></b><font face="Georgia">eobux is one of the internet's 
	most innovative and lucrative money making PTC's. With nearly 20,000,000 members, this proves 
	without a doubt that they are a legitimate company. In the 5 years that they have been online, they 
	have paid over $80 million to their members. That is good news right?</p>
</font></p>

<p><b>Wrong! </b><br /> If they paid out over 80 million in cashouts to almost 20 million members, that means 
	<i>the average Neobux user makes <b>$4.00</b></i>. That doesn't add up if you ask me. But wait, 
	aren't lots of people making ultra profits from Neobux? Sure, you hear success stories and see 
	payment proofs of those users who are making it big...</p>
	
<p><i>But what about most other users</i> - people like you and me? </p>

<p>The ugly truth of the matter is, most people who join PTC's, also known as 
	"<b>pay to click</b>" sites, barely make any money, and those who've invested money come out at a 
	<b>loss</b>. Many of those who try PTC's do so with the right intentions...they work hard patiently, 
	hoping to eventually make profit. But after <i>months</i> of hard work, they are not seeing results, 
	become frustrated, and ultimately give up. </p>

<h2>And it's not their fault.</h2>

<p>I have seen so many good people quit these programs out of sheer
frustration that it saddens me...yet that is the reality of the system.</p>

<p>One very important part of success is direct referrals. But they are not that easy to get...
you have to promote, promote, promote. And after all that work, you still didn't get any referrals.</p>

<center><p>Does getting referrals feel like this?</p>
<img src="<?=$imgDir?>frustrated.jpg" alt="Neobux Direct Referrals" title="Neobux Direct Referrals"></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>So why do most people fail in PTC's?</h2>

<p align="left">The answer is simple: they do not have a working strategy. 
They joined Neobux with unrealistic expectations, hoping to make it rich quick. But
when they realize that it is not making money fast, they start to become 
frustrated and lose hope. If this is you right now, then you are at the right place - 
keep reading and don't miss a word.</p>

<p>You've probably tried to find the answer on some blog or random website - and you
searched frantically, hoping to find that one answer that will solve all your problems.
Afte reading some strategies, you tried different ways to recycle referrals, renew
referrals, and renting referrals. But none of them seem to produce the results
you wanted. </p></font>

<p>My name is Benjamin, and I have been using PTC's for over 3 years now. 
I understand your frustration - because I've been there. I know what it's like to 
to work extremely hard at PTC's and not get the results. I'd click everyday diligently, 
rent referrals and try to do the "math" ... but when I stare at my account 
balance, I wonder if the work I do is worth it. </p>

<p>I began to ask myself, what was I doing wrong? What was I doing differently than others who were
successful? I began searching for the answer...and I found bits and pieces of information that helped,
but never a complete solution. So I continued to search frantically. And what I discovered shocked me.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Introducing the Ultimate Strategy</h2>

<p align="left">In the Neobux Ultimate Strategy eBook, I am going to show you what the <i>top 10%</i> of
Neobux users are doing to make <b>tremendous profits</b> in Neobux...and it works for <b>any pay to click site</b>. 
The principles are the same no matter what program you are in.</p></font>

<p>You're probably skeptical right now, wondering how much is all this going to cost you. But before
we get there, let me ask you something...</p>

<p><b>Are you one of those users who make only $4.00 from Neobux? </b></p>

<p>Does this describe you...</p>

<p>You join Neobux with much excitement, and you click on ads diligently like you're supposed to. 
Then you rent some referrals (which took you a while, since you make 0.001 per click) and hope that they
click actively and earn for you. But those referrals become inactive, and you recycle them, hoping the
new ones will be better. By now, even though you have lots of referrals, you still have to constantly
replace them, and you're barely making profit. </p>

<p>Then you become frustrated and stop clicking, and join a new PTC.</p>

<p>And then you go back to step 1, and the pattern repeats itself. Then you begin to wonder why you're not being rewarded for doing the right thing. Aren't
<u>you</u> tired of living in this vicious cycle of failure? Don't you want a way out? </p>

<p>With this strategy, you can say goodbye to the following problems: </p>

<p align="left">
<ul class="crossList">
<li><p>No more wondering why you aren't profiting, even though you have rented referrals</p></li>
<li><p>No more struggling to find direct referrals</p></li>
<li><p>No more wondering if you are recycling the right way</p></li>
<li><p>No more staring at your account balance and being disappointed</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Skeptical? Then look at all these referrals...</h2>

<h2>Does This Work with Multi Level PTC's?</h2>
