<p><b>Dear PTC User,</b></p>

<p><b><font face="tahoma" size="6">M</font></b>aking money online seems to be getting harder and harder, isn't it? When you join a PTC site, all you have to do is click a few ads and earn a few cents, and then rent some referrals. But that just isn't enough. In the Neobux Ultimate Strategy, we've covered <i>the key to being successful</i> is <b>direct referrals.</b>
</p>

<p>It's a known fact that having a PTC mini-site that lists your PTC's is a good way to get referrals. All you have to do is promote one link.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Benjamin. I have been a PTC user since 2009 - I have joined many sites in my PTC journey - some good, some bad, some ugly. I've done the same things everyone else has - I joined a bunch of sites and promoted all of my referral links at once - and it was exhausting work! </p>

<p>However, I had one thing that put me at an advantage over many others - my background is in web design and web development. I've seen a few people make a PTC website, so I decided to do that, so I can get direct referrals. All I had to do was promote my website, and the referrals automatically joined my bux sites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Promoting PTC's is a LOT of Hard Work</h2>

<p>I know how you feel because I've been there. I was trying to promote Neobux and everything else at the same time, joining forums, doing downline builders, and buying banner ads for 15 to 20 sites at a time. It just made me overwhelmed and exhausted. I knew I could not keep that up. </p>

<p>So I created my PTC website and I decided to promote only that website and nothing else. It made my work a lot easier, and I was seeing more results than before! Promoting one link instead of 15 to 20 is the best strategy you can implement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>That's nice, but I don't have a website...</h1>

<p>If you are like thousands of others, you have probably tried to make your own website, but with no success. You've probably tried blogger, weebly, and maybe google websites, and some other free services. And you find out that <i>you get what you paid for</i> - complicated and messy editors, unclear instructions, and ultimately, <u>the result is <b>not</b> what you want</u>.</p>

<p>A free service is better than nothing, right? But you have no control over the design, the content, and overall feel of the website. Seriously, if you do not like your own website, how do you think your visitors will feel? And if they don't like the website, why would they join as your referral? </p>

<p>Presentation is everything - your site needs to be clean and professional to lure people to joining your PTC's. I have seen a lot of "ugly" looking websites, and I am surprised that people are actually promoting them. If I were them I would just shut it down and start from scratch...</p>

<p><i>Your website could be losing referrals right now as we speak</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Even if you want to have a website...</h2>

<p>You have to pay for web hosting fees, don't you? And on top of that, someone has to design it for you, and that costs money too. Probably more than you can afford. Most sites costs anywhere between $400 to $500 dollars, even for a simple design. For more advanced designs, the site can cost an arm and a leg.</p>

<p>For a PTC user, that is out of your budget - so you have to settle for the free service - and I already went over why they don't work. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What I Discovered</h1>

<p>Advertising one site may bring you some referrals, but it is inefficient, and you are leaving a lot of people out. Imagine this: you are advertising your Neobux link, and if your prospects are already in Neobux, then they will not be interested, and then they will leave and you've wasted your efforts.</p>


<p>Advertising all your sites may seem like a better idea, but that is very time consuming. You join new sites and remove scam sites, so you have to update your website list often. That's when I realized that having a PTC mini-site is a must. To not have one is like going to battle without any weapons! To survive in this business (the PTC business), you must be properly equipped with the right tools, lest you will not survive. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Introducing PTC Mini-Sites</h2>

<p>Just imagine...</p>

<p>A single page that allows you to <i>promote all your sites</i> with just one link...</p>

<p>A mini-site service that lists all your favorite websites, customized specifically for YOUR needs</p>

<p>A website with up to 10 pages, that has everything you want on it - Facebook apps, widgets, payment proofs,
rotating banners, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Our Special Offer</h1>

<p>The PTC Mini-Site is my answer to the problems stated above. A mini-site seems like a simple thing, but it is a powerful tool you can have in your arsenal. It doesn't matter if you just started PTC's, having a mini-site will gain you instant credibility with your visitors - and they will join with people that they trust.</p>

<p>Don't worry, we won't put any advertisements on your site - they are 100% under your ownership. That's saying alot, considering some free services put ads on the top and bottom of your site. Who really wants that on their site? </p>

<h2>What if I Already Have a Website?</h2>

<p>No problem. If you already have a domain hosted somewhere else, we will update your site and give it a complete makeover - at no additional cost. </p>

<p>Like we said, these files are yours to keep no matter what. You will get unlimited hosting space on bestpayingsites.com - and if at some point in the future, you wishto move your website to another server, we will transfer your website for you at no extra charge. </p>

<br />
<h3 align="center">Did you know...</h3>

<p>That the <b>top banner</b> (the ones that are 729 x 90) receive twice as many referrals as regular banners? Make your favorite PTC the top banner, and watch the referrals roll in. Once you max out your direct referrals, switch your top banner to another PTC. </p>

<p>People are more likely to join when you put <b>payment proofs</b> on your website? If you've received a cashout from Neobux, then put that screenshot on your site, and link that screenshot to your referral link. It's just another trick that people use to get referrals - and of course, they don't want to share their secrets with you. </p>

<p>Even if you have a PTC website, chances are you are not using it correctly - you are not maximizing your rate of return.</p>

<p>Now that we've listed all the benefits, how much do you think the PTC Mini-Site should cost?</p>

<p>Don't companies usually charge $500 to $1000 for a complete website? </p>

<p>But you're not going to pay $1000. (That's ridiculous!)</p>

<p>You're not going to pay $500. </p>

<p>Not even $200! </p>

<h1>The PTC Mini-Sites will cost you <br>a one time fee of <span class="red">$<?=$itemPrice?></span></h1>

<p>I think you'll agree that's a very good price compared to a lot of other web design services. It's not just a discount, it's a steal! We are only doing this special offer as a special incentive to you as a customer the Neobux Ultimate Strategy. </p>
