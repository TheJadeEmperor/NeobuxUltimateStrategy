<p>Hi subscribers, </p>

<p>As you know, Clixsense is a PTC website that allows you to earn from 8 levels of 
	referrals. I want to grow my team so I thought up this idea of having a rotating
	banner on my blog. People can join my Clixsense team by clicking on the banner. 
</p>
	
<p>You can join through the banner on the header or the banner below. If you are on my
	team I can help you grow your team, as it benefits all of us. </p>

<p>Just write your username and referral link in the comments below. Your link will 
	be added to the banner rotater for 24 hours. </p>

<p>If you are not part of Clixsense join now:</p>

<a href="<?=$referralLink?>" title="Clixsense Team"><img src="http://bestpayingsites.com/images/banners/clixsense.gif"
    alt="Clixsense Team" /></a>


<p>How does it work? </p>


<p>My idea is simple - I will be promoting this page in my newsletters and various other places. 
	People will join through the banners and whoever's link is live will get the referrals. A
	link will be up for 24 hours and then it will be replaced by the next link in te line. </p>

<p>If you want your link to be on the rotator then you just have to fulfill some simple requirements.</p>

<p>1. Be a member of my Clixsense team </p>

<p>2. Be active for at least 15 days in Clixsense </p>

<p>If you meet those requirements then go ahead and put your referral link below. Results are not guaranteed. 
	There is no way to determine how many referrals you will receive on a given day, if any at all. </p>
