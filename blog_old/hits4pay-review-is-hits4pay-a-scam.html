<?$referralLink = 'http://hits4pay.com/members/index.cgi?TheEmperor';?><p>At <b>Hits4pay</b> you can earn some extra cash by reading commercial emails. You will be paid 0.02 to 0.01 per email offer you read. Their rate is better than most PTC and Aurora sites, which only give you 0.005 per click or something like that. </p><p>	Every time you have an advertisement available for you to view, Hits4Pay will notify you via email. The ad itself does not go to your email address, only an alert is sent to your email address.However we highly recommend logging in every day and checking to see if an email is waiting for you. You will never know what you'll miss out on - some offers expire really quickly (in 24 hours or less). </p><p>Hits4Pay was established in 2001, which means they have been in business for over 10 years. 	This is a great sign of a stable PTC. They have changed a lot over the years, but they will	definitely be around for many years to come.</p><h3>What Are the Benefits of Using Hits4Pay?</h3><p><i>A super high referral earnings rate</i></p><p>You will earn 0.01 per click from your referrals, which is one of the best rates out there. If you	are good at getting referrals, then this site will be fantastic for you. However, if you don't have	referrals, it may take a while to cashout.  </p>	<p>If you use the Neobux Ultimate Strategy with Hits4Pay, then you will build a huge downline in this site, and you can earn a nice chunk of money every month. </p><p>To get paid to read emails, join by clicking the banner below: </p><center>    <p align="center"><a href="http://hits4pay.com/members/index.cgi?TheEmperor" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://hits4pay.com/imgn/banners/468x60.png" width="468" height="60"></a></p></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>A $5.00 sign up bonus?</i></p><p>In addition to their high rates, you will get $5.00 in your account just for signing up. That's free    money! However, their bonus will expire soon, so take action now before you miss out on the bonus.</p><p>On a side note, their sign up bonus used to be $10.00 - it was reduced to $5.00 some time ago.     So don't wait any longer to join, there might not be a bonus if you procrastinate too much.</p><p><i>2 Levels of Referrals</i></p><p>Not only can you have unlimited referrals, but you can earn from 2 levels of downlines. You	will earn 0.01 per click from both levels.</p><p>Here is a tip for those of you who wants to build a solid team. Help your 1st level referrals	build a downline - this helps them make money, and if they are making money, they will continue	to be active and make you money. </p><p>You don't have to give them a lot, just 4 or 5 referrals will do. Most uplines won't even	help them, so by doing this, you show that you are different and you care. </p><p><i>A good reputation</i></p><p>Even PTC investigations has put Hits4Pay as one of their "elite" sites. This is the highest     honor that can be given to a PTC, only a chosen few are named elite sites. </p><p>We have been a member of Hits4Pay since April of 2010. From talking to other members I have heard nothing but good praises about this site. You will not get rich, but it is something you can do to earn a little cash on the side.  </p><center>    <p align="center"><a href="http://hits4pay.com/members/index.cgi?TheEmperor" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://hits4pay.com/imgn/banners/468x60.png" width="468" height="60"></a></p></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Automatic cashout</i></p><p>Hits4Pay is unique in that they pay you automatically once you reach the threshold of $25.00. 	It means you don't need to cashout manually, once you reach $25 or more the payment will be 	automatically sent to you. You will be paid by either check or paypal.</p><h3>Are there any downsides to Hits4Pay?</h3><p><i>Account approval</i></p><p>All new accounts have to be manually approved by them. This is not a big deal since they approve	almost everyone, however, there have been cases where members were not approved for one reason	or another. If they do not approve your account within a few days, contact their customer service	support.</p>	<p><i>Enter your tax info</i></p><p>Most PTC's won't even ask you for your address. All they need is your name and email address. 	Hits4Pay, however, requires you to enter your tax information before you can get paid. </p>	<p>It's an extra step you have to do, but you only have to do it once. I think it's worth the trouble	of doing this for the ability to have automatic cashouts for the rest of my life. What do you think?</p><p><i>Cashout is high</i></p><p>Most PTC's let you cashout at $1 or $2, but at Hits4Pay it's $25. This is very high for many	people, especially if you don't have referrals. So the best way to make money with this PTC	is to use the Neobux Ultimate Strategy to get hundreds of referrals within the first month, 	so that they make you money month after month. </p><h3>Ready to Make Some Money?</h3><p>So, are you getting paid to read emails? I know I do!</p><p>If you're not in Hits4Pay, then you are missing out on a lot of money. Don't waste another day - start earning right away by adding Hits4Pay to your PTC collection. </p><p>Happy earnings!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Benjamin Louie <br />    Neobux Ultimate Strategy<br /><a href="http://neobuxultimatestrategy.com">http://neobuxultimatestrategy.com</a></p>
