<p>Today I want to tell you about a Neobux feature that's been around for a while, yet
	has been under-rated. The Neobux Toolbar is a useful tool that can help you make
	more money by telling when ads are available for clicking. </p>
	
<p>If you have not tried the toolbar, called AdAlert, you should consider doing it. Make more
	money by being informed when ads are available for clicking. All you have to do is 
	keep your browser open and keep your eye on the toolbar. </p>
	
<p>It takes almost no space at all and is easy to install. You'll also have your updated balance 
	at the distance of a single click without disturbing you from what you're doing in your computer.</p>

<p>It is available for all major browsers, and the toolbar will be automatically updated (depending on your browser's settings) so that you'll always have the latest version.</p>

<p>The download link for AdAlert is at the bottom of the Neobux website. You will see this link after you login. </p>

<p>Try it out. If you don't like it, you can always uninstall at the click of a button. </p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
